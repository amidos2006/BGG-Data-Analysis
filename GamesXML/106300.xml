You must compose a line of poetry, using some aspect of the illustration from each card as the source for one word.  You may make free use of conjunctions, prepositions, article, pronouns, forms of &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot; and forms of &amp;quot;to have&amp;quot;.  After your line is complete, players rotate seats; you will then write the second line of your poem in the same way with the new set of 6 cards now in front of you.  Players rotate seats one more time to write the third line of their poems, and then execute scoring.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will distribute 5 points among your favorite poem(s), and then evaluate the 6-card row for which you did not compose a line, awarding 4 points among the players for the best line(s), and 1 point for the best use of each card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who receives the most points has composed a poem for the ages!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The game can be played by creating quick random matches, or by competing using tournament mode. In tournament mode fighters face off against each other in a best two out of three, single elimination, competition in hopes of challenging the reigning champion, Gabriel. &amp;#10;During matches players compete by rolling dice, building attack sequences, and unleashing tactical combinations of punches, kicks and critical blows. Each fighter has their own signature ability and a handful of resources available to them during each match. Learning to maximize your dice rolls and understanding when to utilize your special abilities and Rumble cards is integral to victory. Throw too much, too quickly, at your opponent and your fighter may end up exhausted fighting an uphill battle!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The first player to earn 3 Victory points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fantasy game world of Familiar takes place in the 12 realms of Elytha Tira. Those who live there are skilled in the use of a magical power source called Elyth.

However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from the publisher's website.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;About the game:&amp;#10;Coloma is the town where an unexpected event happened that shaped history of the Western Frontier. In the winter of 1848 a man building a sawmill on the South Fork of the American River spotted some bright nuggets in the tailrace waters below. Sure enough, it was gold! Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, word spread quickly and it triggered the California Gold Rush of &amp;lsquo;49.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thousands of people arrived from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing boomtowns in the country. Claims were staked, camps and makeshift homes were built, and hotels and saloons sprung up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their cut of the land&amp;rsquo;s wealth. For many it was Coloma or Bust!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game of Coloma, you are a pioneer who has recently traveled out West to strike it rich and make a name for yourself. You will prospect for gold and use your windfalls to recruit workers, rustle up horses, and establish businesses. You will also get opportunities to explore the surrounding riverways and frontier lands. But alas! You are not alone&amp;mdash;every other pioneer seems to have gotten the same idea! Therefore, it will take extra cunning tactics on your part to not go Bust with the rest of them&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overview of Play&amp;#10;At the beginning of each chapter, you and the other players will simultaneously select an action to perform on the board. Once your selections are revealed, you must check if a majority of players chose the same action. If so, it is a Bust&amp;mdash;which disables the Boom bonus that would be included otherwise. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons on the map, building bridges and businesses, and placing camps and gunmen. After that, a section of the board is rotated&amp;mdash;slightly changing the layout of the actions for the upcoming chapter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the rotating section hits high noon, the round ends with a bang: a shootout against an ever-growing number of outlaws! If you and the other players can outnumber the outlaws with your combined gunmen, you will get your fair share of the rewards. But if not, the rewards drop, and some of the gunmen will go to the graveyard... The game ends after the third shootout, and the player with the most points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Coloma is a fast moving game with many paths to victory. It offers unique twists on simultaneous action selection, resource management, and engine-building. The town cards in your tableau allow you to play more efficiently, gain extra actions, and bend the rules to your advantage. With these cards and the bridge tiles (which add points based on what you achieve), you can create the perfect combination for your strategy and play style.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

He leaves behind nothing but a decimated lab, a pair of ash-covered, blastresistant shoes, and a job opening... for Quartermaster.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now, a team of auditors are cracking down over concerns of health and safety within the facility and are systematically restricting access to each lab. You and the other Quarternovices must scramble to use the blueprints that survived the blast to create the best spy gadget, and win the promotion to Quartermaster!&amp;#10;Applicants beware - with stakes this high, no-one is above sabotage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Quartermaster: Apply Within is a 10 - 20 minute compact, inventive and ruthless game built around worker-placement and pattern-making. Each turn sees 1-4 players (or Quaternovices) scramble to collect the parts needed to build incredible spy gadgets, while protecting their prototypes against sabotage from devious co-workers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With a setup influenced by both player choice and chance, and the option to replace up to three players with an AI, Quartermaster: Apply Within is flexible, dynamic, and addictively replayable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The duel competition where participants fight to bring glory to their city in a demonstration of strength and prowess, using skills from the Schools of Knowledge to defeat their opponent. From the defensive Water Magic to offensive Assassination Path each School of Knowledge has its own style offering diverse duels. The Champions join an elite group of fighters ready to defend the land of Ambal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ambal Tournament is a Card Game released in sets (meaning players don&amp;rsquo;t have to buy packs where they get random cards, instead they will acquire sets with all the cards available) in which competitors build their decks before and during battle using cards from up to two Schools of Knowledge. Each School represent an area of knowledge with their own set of cards and have their own style of play.&amp;#10;Duels can be 1vs1 or 2vs2 and turns are simultaneous, meaning each player puts their skill face down and reveals them at the same time. A player might block or interrupt their opponent&amp;rsquo;s skill or cause different effects depending on the skill the opponent is using.&amp;#10;Players can use different types of skills such as Spells or Actions and secondary effects like Burning, Poison and Bleeding.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

You are part of a happy hippie community and looking for self-realization &amp;ndash; free love and marijuana consumption included!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You are the only inhabitants of this idyllic little island in the middle of a lonely lake. Your commune feeds itself largely self-sufficiently &amp;ndash; thanks to the fruit and vegetable production and the multitude of free-range happy animals. Your hemp plantation provides a relaxed atmosphere and a financial boost. Three weeks ago you harvested them together. So spiritual enlightenment is assured!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tonight at your celebration in honour of the moon god Chandra you will finally test the new harvest &amp;ndash; it's high time, because the old stocks are completely used up!

						               													<description>The Phantom Card Game is an adventure game. You play alone or cooperate with a friend. You are in the world of The Phantom and can seek help from allies, using weapons and actions to support you. Players experience exciting adventures by using cunning to overcome problems and defeat enemies.&amp;#10; Each round, players face a new problem that needs to be taken care of, but with limited resources and plays it is important to make good decisions to overcome short term obstacles, achieve the long term goal and at the same time evolve your supply of actions, items and allies. Any enemies that are not dealt with will injure you, making it hard to come back to full speed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The starter pack is for 1 player, but with a companion pack the game can be played with up to two players.&amp;#10;In this starter pack you follow the footsteps of the Phantom and experience how he met and bonded with his trusted wolf Devil.  Based on Team Fantomen's 1979 publication The Story of Devil, written by Donne Avenell and drawn by Georges Bess.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Little Battle might be thought of as a child's first drafting game. The game includes a deck of 27 animal cards in blue, yellow, and red, with values from roughly 1-10. At the start of a round, each player gets a hand of five cards, places one of them face down on their longship, passes the cards left, chooses another card, etc. until they have five cards on their longship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;They then take these cards in hand, and everyone simultaneously chooses a card and places it face down on the table. You're using these animals to win treasure chests, which also come in blue, yellow, and red. The chests are shuffled and placed in two piles. You play your card by a face-up chest, then everyone reveals their card:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    If your animal doesn't match the color of the chest, remove it from play.&amp;#10;    If only one animal is by a chest, that player's owner claims it.&amp;#10;    If multiple animals are by a chest, whoever played the highest number wins the chest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Continue to play until you've played all five cards. If any chests remain, shuffle the animal cards and play another round. Once all the chests have been claimed, turn over the chest cards and count the coins on them to see who has the biggest treasure haul!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes three animal chiefs that have a value of 0, but a unique special ability that can possibly win you a chest you wouldn't have got otherwise. Shuffle them into the animal deck for an additional challenge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Monster is a gambling game in which the best&amp;#10;hand must defeat the Monster, a hand made&amp;#10;from everyone&amp;rsquo;s discards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Equipment: &amp;#10;A Pairs deck.  A button for indicating the&amp;#10;dealer, and chips for keeping score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To Begin: &amp;#10;   Start by paying an ante into the pot. If you have 4 or 5 players, the ante is 2 chips. With 6 to 8 players, the ante is 1 chip.  &amp;#10;   Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. The player on the dealer&amp;rsquo;s left will act first. (Move the dealer button only after a full game, i.e., after the pot clears.)&amp;#10;   Each player acts once, in turn. On your turn, you may discard zero to three cards, or fold. You are not allowed to keep a hand that includes a pair; if this is your only choice, you must fold.  You may want to fold some other hands as well,&amp;#10;depending on circumstances&amp;#10;   Your discards go facedown into a pile in the middle, which becomes the Monster&amp;rsquo;s hand. Folded cards do not go to the Monster; they go completely out of play. Note: This is not draw poker. Your discarded cards are not replaced!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Showdown: &amp;#10;After each player on the next page) becomes the &amp;ldquo;Champion,&amp;rdquo; and&amp;#10;must compare hands with the Monster. When the Champion faces the Monster,he must defeat it in order to take the pot. The&amp;#10;Monster wins ties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the Champion loses (or ties), he pays 5 chips to the pot and is knocked out of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Definition of High Hand: &amp;#10;Any player hand that contains a pair is a losing hand, and&amp;#10;can&amp;rsquo;t be kept for the showdown. All hands in the showdown will be compared by highest card, then second highest card, and so on. The best player hand is 10-9-8-7-6-5. A card is better than nothing, so a hand of 10-8-7-4 is better than 10-8-7.  This is similar to comparing poker hands for high card, except that there is no limit on the number of cards that can play. The Monster uses the same rules, but it ignores duplicate cards. Treat the Monster as if it had only one card of each rank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning: &amp;#10;To win the pot, you must become the Champion and defeat the monster. If no one wins, play another round with only the&amp;#10;surviving players. Players who folded, or who lost a fight with the Monster, are out. All cards are reshuffled in the next round&amp;#10;(the Monster does not keep its cards).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Oddities: If one player is left, he automatically wins. If zero players are left, either because they all had to fold, or because the last player couldn&amp;rsquo;t defeat his own discards, then play again with the same players who started the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ties: &amp;#10;If two Champions win with exactly the same hand, they split the pot. If two Champions have the same hand but lose to the Monster, they must each drop out and pay the 5 chip penalty, unless they are the only two players remaining, in which case they pay 5 chips but play another round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Strategy: In the first few rounds, you may want to &amp;ldquo;duck,&amp;rdquo; playing low hands and trying not to become the Champion. As players leave the game, it becomes easier to defeat the Monster, because it is getting fewer cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Slasher Movie can be scary, ridiculous, gory, trashy, witty social commentary or just dumb fun.  SLASHR is a fast playing, free wheeling Slasher Movie emulator captured in 9 simple playing cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before starting play, make sure that you set the rating for this movie (a PG-13 game is very different than the Hard R version).  If we are okay with our movie getting a hard R Rating, make sure that the players are all comfortable with that.  You may want to check out some standard RPG safety mechanics - such as an X-CARD.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Have everyone sit around a circle.  Take your 'SLASHR deck, shuffle it, and put it in the middle of the area you are playing, in easy reach for all the players.  If you really want to get in the mood, service some greasy popcorn, turn the lights down and sing &amp;quot;Let's All Go to the Lobby&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a group, come up with a setting for a 1980s-style exploitation flick.  Once you have a setting, settle on a title for the film.  The setting and title are going to really lock down what the players do over the course of the movie.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player is the last person to have seen a horror movie.  They begin the game by introducing themselves (their actual self) as starring as a character in the movie.  So, for instance, let's say that we are playing a movie called Unholy Pigskin (a PG-13 slasher about a High School Football team full of vampires.  You would say something like, &amp;quot;Starring CHris O'Neill as Head Coach N. Romancer  Then have the next player in the circule introduce themselves and so on, until everyone has been introduced.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player will then take a turn creating a scene in the Movie.  The most important thing to remember is that you are SETTING UP A SCENE - not resolving it.  To properly set up a scene, it should involve your character, at least one other character, and a location. These two players should both want something, or need an answer to a question.  This simple mechanic should drive us immediately into action.  &amp;quot;Okay, so the Cheerleader and I are having a fight in the parking lot about leaving town.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the scene starts, the players can start role-playing their characters, or narrating activity in the scene.  Anyone that is not directly involved in the scene acts as additional &amp;quot;uncredited&amp;quot; characters and background effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When one of the following happens, ANY PLAYER should yell CUT!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     A Character is about to get the thing they want.&amp;#10;     A Character is about to get the answer to a question.&amp;#10;     Anything stupid, weird, or dangerous occurs.&amp;#10;     Things are getting slow or boring in any way.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whenever someone yells CUT! the active player takes the SLASHR deck, cuts it, and flips over the top card.  Depending on the card, the scene is then resolved in a specific way.  After resolving the scene, shuffle the deck and play passes to the next player clockwise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FEAR, LUST, LIES, GREED, or STUPIDITY(THE RED CARDS) If the player cuts to a RED CARD, they resolve the scene in their favor using the prompt on the card, then return that card to the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MURDERED (BLACK CARDS)&amp;#10;When you pull a BLACK CARD, you got Murdered.  In the game, this means that this scene - no matter what it was about - ends in your grisly murder at the hands of the SLASHR KILLR.  Only the ACTIVE PLAYER dies, and they always get to narrate their own death!  If the Slasher has not been revealed yet, the death should be laden with mystery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you die, you flip over the remaining cards in the SLASHR deck and take one of the 5 RED CARDS out (Fear, Lust, Lies, Greed, and Stupidity) and plays it face up in front of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When your character has been eliminated, you are still playing.  If it becomes your turn again, instead of setting up a scene with your character - you set up and narrate a quick scene using your prompt as inspiration.  You are encouraged to be the unnamed people in the other player's scenes in the movie, to add narration, to make sound effects, and to shout encouragement from your theater seats.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Don't forget to put the BLACK CARD back into the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;DON'T TURN AROUND&amp;#10;If the player cuts to DON'T TURN AROUND, they have a brush with Death, but don't die.  Early on in the game, when this happens - the player should narrate their &amp;quot;jump scare&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cheap heat&amp;quot; moment - cats jumping out, car crashes, kids pretending to be the murderer, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After the SLASHR is in play, this card should always result in a near death experience with the SLASHR KILLR.  Put the card back in the deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SLASHR&amp;#10;When you flip the SLASHR card - you are the SLASHR.  You should resolve the scene as the SLASHR, revealing your identity and motive.  You get to resolve the scene in your favor - but as your can only die when you are the active player, your opponent in the scene does not get killed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;YOUR INEVITABLE GRISLY DEATH&amp;#10;As you play, you will be removing cards form the deck, and making it MORE LIKELY that the next player is going to die. With either (a) the deck runs out of RED Cards, or (b) there is only the SLASHR. and one other person alive; the game ends.  Each player that was eliminated during the game gets a chance to &amp;quot;pitch&amp;quot; the ending of the movie to the remaining player(s).  The ending should involved the survivors defeating the SLASHR or getting away.  Afterwards, the SLASHRget to add a &amp;quot;sequel clause&amp;quot; scene where they show how they actually survived for the next movie.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

We sloths are sitting around, of course, while all the other animals run throughout the resort. We want to look around, too&amp;hellip;if not for being so lazy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Getting across the country resort to pick up tasty leaves would be great! But running around ourselves really is just too tedious. All the other animals are having fun, and we want that, too, but&amp;hellip;we are so slothful.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And then we have an idea: We'll let ourselves be carried around by the other animals, thus getting around nicely. The others animals have so much energy that they'll even gladly carry us. They are not slothful!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Which of us sloths will be the first to get through the entire country and be victorious? We are ambitious, but&amp;hellip; so lazy!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faultier is a fast race game in which you are carried along the whole way. At its core, it is a classic pick-up-and-deliver game &amp;mdash; except that we ourselves are the cargo being delivered. We never take a single step on our own!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faultier is one of the rare games that will challenge experienced gamers as well as offer great fun for families. It is a game free from randomness that evolves only through the interaction between the players, doing so without any &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; mechanisms. You just snatch the animals from under the other players noses because you need them yourselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faultier both rewards strategic planning for future turns and tactical decisions in favorable situations. It feels clear and casual, but you need to keep an eye on the other players to check their options.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You always play with six out of twelve different animal species, and you can place the giant game board in four different combinations. Each race offers new challenges for you to get to the different trees faster than the other sloths. Enjoy all 256 different combinations, each with countless starting positions of the animals on the game board...and we are already working on new game boards and more animals for even more fun combinations!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

You may play as one of the warring vampire clans such as Ventrue, Tremere, Gangrel, or Toreador, or perhaps you'll choose to become one of the human factions fighting for their own desires, such as City Hall, the Mafia, or the Arcanum, with many more from which to choose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, the game integrates the story world of Vampire: The Masquerade by adding storyteller scenarios that add an optional narrative approach to the game. Players also gain disciplines, which give them powerful supernatural abilities unique to their character. Lastly, teams will choose their ambitions, which allow for multiple paths to victory, such as being bloodthirsty, manipulative, greedy, or somewhere in between.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Blood Feud is dubbed a &amp;quot;Mega Board Game&amp;quot; because unlike a traditional board game, it isn't played at a single table. Blood Feud requires a large room or two separate rooms with 2-4 tables. One game table features the Cityscape and Orders, the map where players move their forces around the city and order them to fight and take control of important territories. The other game table features the Council and Market, where players use their best diplomatic and resource management skills to make sly trades, buy upgrades and player level-ups, and make large political decisions that will shape the destinies of teams to determine whether they win or lose! In order to win the game, teams earn victory points through the completion of legacies, which are secret objectives that can consist of all sorts of tasks and achievements  earned through gameplay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Playing on a famous horror movie trope, Final Girl is a solitaire-only game that puts the player in the shoes of a female protagonist who must kill the slasher if she wants to survive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In game terms, Final Girl shares similarities with Hostage Negotiator, but with some key differences that change it up, including a game board to track locations and character movement. You can choose from multiple characters when picking someone to play and multiple killers when picking someone to play against. Killers and locations each have their own specific terror cards that will be shuffled together to create a unique experience with various combinations of scenarios for you to play!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Finally, there is the popular game of skill from the &amp;quot;Super Toy Club&amp;quot; for home! With a lot of team spirit and good communication, the players have to roll the ball from start to finish. Each player is responsible for one corner of the three-dimensional game board and only together can the goal be achieved. For this skill and concentration is required, because otherwise, the ball falls into one of the numerous holes. If that happens the team has to start again. But watch out, time is running fast and the other team is just waiting for their chance. In Labyrinthia, two teams play against each other. The team that works smarter and works better together will win in the end. Stops the time and challenges the opposing team: which team is faster?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
