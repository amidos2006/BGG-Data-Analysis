						               													<description>The date is May 7, 1896. On this day H.H. Holmes was hanged, for the murder of at least 9 innocent victims, but suspected of much, much more. Or was he?&amp;#10;Perhaps he succeeded in framing an unknowing employee of his famous Horror Hotel? Let's find out!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Holmes' Horror Hotel players assume the roles of either employees of the hotel, or the owner himself, H.H. Holmes. The roles are secret, so only the player that is dealt the Holmes character knows who is who.&amp;#10;The employees know by now that danger is afoot in the hotel, but they don't know who is behind it all. And on this dark night in 1896, they find all the doors and windows of the hotel locked.&amp;#10;There is no escape, their only chance is to expose the serial killer before they all die a gruesome death&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players in turn draw 1-3 cards. These cards can be traps, clues or dead ends. Traps hurt you and can eliminate you from the game, clues can be used to identify the killer- or frame an innocent coworker - and dead ends are... dead ends and should be discarded. The employees have to play all their cards truthfully, only Holmes can lie and discard unwanted traps or clues. But when he gets called out on this, it's game over for him. Can the employees survive and identify Holmes as the killer in their midst before time runs out?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Holmes' Horror Hotel is a fast game of deduction and hidden identities, for 4 to 7 players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A Point to point board wargame on the One year war focusing exclusively on the original Gundam TV anime show which ran from 1979 to 1980.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2 maps &amp;#10;204 counters&amp;#10;9 pages of rules&amp;#10;2 charts&amp;#10;1 turn= 1 month&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For 2 players where one player plays the Earth Federation and the other plays the Zeon Principality. Units are comprise of Mobile suit units, and space fleets. Also represented are important characters to the anime like Amuro Rey, Char Aznable etc. these characters can influence unit combat give modifiers etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two maps represent the Earth and the near space, with important Earth and space regions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory is done via Victory points, the one that has the highest victory points by the end of the game (month 12) or gets to a certain number of VPs before the end of the game wins sudden death. These VPs can be had by destruction of mech units, death of important characters and conquest of important points in the maps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game looks to be a simplified version of the TDF game One Year War and is for the Gundam purists who only want to focus on the 1979 to 1980 anime and nothing else.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The CG of a formation can activate all of their subordinate units, which can perform actions.

This goes on until the last round is reached, as indicated by the scenario and the winner can be determined according to the victory conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Players manage an economy of resources and play event cards in order to build and expand an empire and destroy their opponents.  There is only one winner in every game of Kingslayer, but there are three paths to victory:  slay an opposing king, control 20 territories, or control the most territories when the deck of event cards runs out.  Kingslayer, at it's core, is an exercise in resource management.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will send spend their resources to send their units into unclaimed territories and to build settlements.  Each territory may contain one settlement and for every settlement built players can add a resource to the resource pool.  Players may use their new resources to continue to move units, build settlements, or attack opposing units.  Players may also spend their resources on recruiting new units, which may only be placed on the same territory as their king, which can not move.  Combat is decided through dice rolls and favors outnumbering your opponent as well as the attacker.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kingslayer uses a unique turn order mechanic which moves in a clockwise order, but only for players with at least one resource currently in the resource pool.  If a player doesn't have any resources in the resource pool, their turn is skipped.  If no resources of any color are in the resource pool, the pool is refreshed and all players draw a card.  As long as players have at least one resource in the resource pool, they may play one card on their turn instead of spending resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

One dice is used initially until space 13 is reached, thereafter two dice are used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The planets have features that either help or hinder the players. Neptune the ice planet causes players to miss a turn and Mars has friendly robots that gives players a token. Venus has lush vegetation, while Mercury is way too hot.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players win the game by being first to return to earth by exact throw of the dice. Upon being first they receive further tokens from the other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game graphics of robots and the planets is similar in style to the Buck Rogers board games of the 1930s.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;No publisher is evident on the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

This is an Australian entry among the crossword-based card games which were very popular in the 1930s. The game is for 2 or more, with two decks being used if 5 or more play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ten cards are dealt to each player. During their turn, a player may do one of the following: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Lay down a complete word from their hand.&amp;#10;     Add letters to an existing word to make another word, either in-line or crossing it as in a crossword puzzle. Adding &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; to make plurals is not allowed.&amp;#10;     Change an existing word into a different word by removing one or more letters and adding one or more letters from the hand. Cards not removed must remain in the same order. &amp;#10;     Discard a card and draw a card from the top of the deck or discard pile. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When one player empties their hand, each other player scores the sum of the values of the cards still in hand. Consonants are 2 points each, vowels are A 25, E 20, I 15, O 10, U 5.  When one player's total reaches 100 or more, the player with the lowest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Die Hard: The Nakatomi Heist Board Game uses one-versus-many, asymmetric gameplay to pit protagonist John McClane against others acting as thieves who are co-operating to foil the hero's plan, which is to save the hostages in the iconic Nakatomi Plaza high-rise. Movie buffs and hobby game enthusiasts will appreciate the game's distinct homage to the 1988 film, which packs rules and gameplay to the air vents with callbacks to Die Hard&amp;rsquo;s most memorable scenes, characters, and events.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

(Note: Its location is being kept a secret as you surely understand.) But that dream world is now troubled... Humans have discovered it and are kidnapping meeples to force them to work in their boardgames. There are only two possible outcomes: Fight the humans, as hard as that would be for the tiny meeples, or build rockets to leave for a new and peaceful planet!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Leading your meeples, you will use trains that lead to different places in which you'll be able to enroll new meeples, repair your wounded foes, acquire resources, build rockets, and fight humans. But be prepared: Your glory will depend on the outcome of the end of the game. If the humans succeed in invading the meeple world before you can escape with the rockets, the one who fought the best will be rewarded; if not, the one who most helped the escape will be. Choose your side wisely!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Save the Meeples is a worker placement game in which placement is disconnected from action, so you have to program your placement in a certain order, but you will take actions in reverse order.&amp;#10;What's more, the winning conditions differ greatly depending on how the game ends ( fight or fly !), under the control of the players, not chance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Each animal is represented by a cardboard cutout that has a raised, second level to identify the animal's mouth. Inside the mouth is a pair of numbers &amp;mdash; one green, one red &amp;mdash; that shows how much vegetarian and meat-based food the animal needs in order to be satisfied.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a player's turn, they first roll the die to determine the difficulty level for that round, then they don the blindfold so that they can't see the playing area. The player scoops up some amount of food from the supply (which has a mix of red and green tokens), reaches out their hand, and tries to place the food in an animal's mouth. Any food that falls out or doesn't match the animal's needs is placed in the giant's intestinal tract. The die roll might let other players give advice (&amp;quot;Move left! Pull your hand back!&amp;quot;) or allow the player to recover one bit of food or otherwise receive aid during the round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In this game, not only you can build a crypto empire, but also you can try to manipulate the market to gain advantage for your own coin or invest and trade your opponents&amp;rsquo; coins to benefit from their success or failures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crypto When Lambo (CWL) board game was inspired by crypto fortunes that were made and lost overnight. Your goal is to build a crypto empire with your own crypto company and coin to become the most successful crypto investor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game takes place across the 8 cities of the world that contain 64 resource producing city tiles. You begin the game with 3 offices, 2 crypto company share cards (each representing 1 million coins), and 5 million game currency. The first player to reach 1 billion or 50 Winning Point Count (WPC) wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To gain WPCs, you must increase the number of your employees, build products, open new offices, complete your management team, ICO your coin, and list it on crypto exchanges. There are 5 resource types (Real Estate, Employee, Management Team, Product, and Crypto Exchange) in the game that allow you to perform various actions to gain points and make money. For example, using 2 Real Estate cards and paying 2 million, you can establish a new office. Each office placed on the board is 2 WPCs and each Product you produce is worth 2 WPCs. There are multiple paths to getting additional points such as by becoming the richest person in the crypto world or leading a crypto company to ICO with several products and employees dominating the markets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How do you acquire these resources? It&amp;rsquo;s very simple. Each turn a player rolls the dice and the total determines which city production centers will produce resources. Different cities have different attributes. For example, New York and London have more management talent but real estate is harder to get. Hong Kong has a lot of employees that can be recruited. New York is highly regulated and harder to have Crypto Exchanges whereas Tokyo and Hong Kong have more Crypto Exchanges that are accessible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How do you earn money? For example, 1 Product card can be traded for 5 million. Other resource cards can be traded for 1 million. You can also trade your resources with other players during your turn. You can also do Crypto Trading during your turn and risk some of your money for potential high reward. You can also make money by buying low and selling high your opponents&amp;rsquo; coins by manipulating the market with CWL Action Cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In CWL, your most important asset is your crypto company shares. You start the game with 2 of 10 company share cards, each representing 1 million coins. In the beginning of the game your coins have zero value. This is tracked by the Coin Price ticker cards you have in front of you always visible to all players.  You must try to acquire as many as your company share cards as you can while they have zero value. You can also acquire other players&amp;rsquo; share cards before they go ICO to benefit from their ICO price hype. Picking the right time for ICO will determine the revenue you will get from your ICO. Number of products, employees, management team, and manipulation of markets will all affect the coin price. You should try to increase your coin price as high as possible before launching your ICO while trying to manipulate your opponents&amp;rsquo; coin prices. This is all done by using combination of resource cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to ICO, a player has to own at least 5 company share cards, a Board of Directors Management card, one of the C-level management cards (CEO, CFO, CIO or CISO) and at least one Employee card. One well timed successful ICO could take you from several million to well above 500 million. ICO is worth 10 WPCs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a strategy involved around placement of Offices on the board in the beginning of the game to trading and manipulation of coin prices to timing of the ICO to raise money. Every game develops differently due to actions of each player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CWL is full of fun with trading, resource management, market manipulation, and teaming concepts. It is simple to learn but hard to master with all the strategies available to you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Get ready for your first adventure on CWL. Have fun building your Crypto Empire!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Players gather kitties from the clowder; then trade, steal, and get even more kitties. Watch out for Crazy Kitty Clashes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before starting, spread all of the kitty cards in the center of the table and each player will take 3 kitties. These are placed face down in front of the player. Shuffle the action cards and place then in a pile near the kitty cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a player's turn, they will draw one action card. If it is green, play right away and do what it says (have a kitty clash, look at another player's kitties, etc). If it is blue, the player will hold on to the card until they are involved in a kitty clash. Blue cards help in kitty clashes to give an extra die, end the clash, roll again if you don't win, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player draws the pink Sleepy Time card, the round ends and all players count up the number of points on all their kitties. The player with the most points wins. Rules suggest playing 5 rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Time to enter a dungeon &amp;mdash; a dungeon composed of dice! &amp;mdash; to kill monsters and score as much as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Dungeon Academy, each player has a piece of paper that shows four dungeons, with each dungeon being a 4x4 grid. The game lasts four rounds, and in each round you will go through one of these dungeons. Each player also has a character card that shows some amount of life (red) and mana (blue) along with a special power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What's actually in a dungeon is determined by dice that you roll at the start of the round. You roll sixteen dice, then let them settle in a 4x4 grid. The dice show red and blue monsters in both small and large sizes, as well as blue potions and red strength. You decide where to enter the dice dungeon and which dice to pass through in a continuous line that can change directions only orthogonally, and you draw this corresponding line on your personal grid until you exit at some other point of the dungeon without crossing over your line. You then claim the lowest available number card, with the number of cards matching the number of players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once everyone has finished drawing a line through the dungeon, you trace out that path step by step, removing life (1 or 2) to defeat red monsters (small or large) and mana (1 or 2) to defeat blue monsters (small or large). You place new tokens on your character as you pass through potions and strength spaces. Once you're through the grid, you score points for the monsters you defeated, and you choose one of four quests on your sheet for bonus points. (In the second round, you choose one of the three remaining quests, so your choices diminish over time.) In player order based on your number card, you take one of the available treasures, which provide points and powers. Your life and mana levels carry over into the next round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the second and third rounds, you replace one of the dice with a labyrinth die that can be passed through only in certain directions, and in the fourth round another die is replaced with the big boss die, giving you something giant to take on before ending the game and tallying your final score.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Per GMT:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The award-winning Musket &amp;amp; Pike Battle Series was launched in 2002 with This Accursed Civil War and followed with Sweden Fights On within a year. Both have been out of print for over a decade. The series has marched on with four more installments and has attracted many new players. These first two games will be available again in a new, updated dual package. In one box, you will get the first two volumes of the MPBS including:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two additional battles for &amp;ldquo;This Accursed Civil War:&amp;rdquo; Cheriton 1644 and Cropredy Bridge 1644. Both battles were in designer Ben Hull's original Desk Top Published version, with Cheriton 1644 appearing later in C3i.  The Edgehill 1642 variant from Gustav Adolf the Great will be included as well.&amp;#10;For all battles, infantry and cavalry units will not be shared between battles for ease of setup and storage.&amp;#10;The battle specific cards introduced in Saints in Armor with be provided with Turn Track, Victory Conditions, Dead and Pursuit boxes to improve their utility (5 back printed cards)&amp;#10;The This Accursed Civil War Playbook will be brought up to the current series standard for ease of use.&amp;#10;Orders of battle and maps will be updated to reflect the latest scholarship.&amp;#10;Last but not least: the counters will feature formation icons requested by so many players over the years!&amp;#10; The Battles are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Edgehill 1642: Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First Newbury 1643: Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry. Essex&amp;rsquo;s stand on Round Hill stopped the Royalist and saved the rebellion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cheriton 1644: Sir William Waller&amp;rsquo;s Southern and Western Association Armies with the help of the London Trained Bands defeated Hopton&amp;rsquo;s Royalists in the rolling hills and hedges. The first in a series of victories in early to mid-1644 the signaled a turning tide in the war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cropredy Bridge 1644: Confident from his victory at Cheriton, Sir William Waller seeks to exploit a gap in the Royalist Main Army on the march. Waller divided his forces and attempted to trap part of the Royalist Army, but difficult terrain and quick reaction by the Royalists turned the tables and left much of Waller&amp;rsquo;s army trapped and he was given a stinging rebuke.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Marston Moor 1644: The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to affect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arose: Cromwell, a name inextricably linked with the English Civil War and the key player in the following two civil wars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Second Newbury 1644: The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Naseby 1645: The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;N&amp;ouml;rdlingen 1634: Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at N&amp;ouml;rdlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wittstock 1636: The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&amp;eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&amp;eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Second Breitenfeld 1642: Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another N&amp;ouml;rdlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jankau 1645: Field Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign against the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emperor himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes. The armies came together in the wooded hill country southeast of Prague.&amp;#10; Components&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Musket &amp;amp; Pike Battle Series Rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;This Accursed Civil War&amp;rdquo; Playbook&amp;#10;&amp;ldquo;Sweden Fights On&amp;rdquo; Playbook&amp;#10;5 Counter Sheets&amp;#10;1 Series Marker Sheet&amp;#10;4.5 Back Printed Map Sheets (For 11 Battles)&amp;#10;6 Two-Sided Battle Specific Player Aid Cards&amp;#10;2 11x17 Folded Player Aid Cards&amp;#10;1 Orders Summary Card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Become heroic White Cell Agents and dive into Templetown, the body-wide city thriving inside Stanley Hasselhoff. &amp;#10;Arm yourself with potent medicine, navigate the bustling streets toward infected areas, and keep his body safe from nasty, invading germs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trouble in Templetown is an immersive cooperative game (1-4 players) wherein you take the role of White Cell Agents, fighting against assaulting germs and viruses. Your mission is to keep the germs in check while building enough immunity walls to insulate Stanley from the spreading infection. &amp;#10;Fail at that, and you'll have one last shot at saving his life by taking on the virus behind this whole thing in an all-or-nothing face-off&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Trouble in Templetown, your goal is to prevent parasites, bacteria, and other nasty invaders from taking over the city. As a cooperative game, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to work together with other players to secure Districts by building Immunity Walls or take the Enemies down in one fell swoop by defeating Frankie Bola, the dangerous kingpin Virus threatening Templetown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Defeat the Enemies by either building Immunity Walls in Districts equal to the number of players OR by defeating Frankie Bola, the deadly virus boss.&amp;#10;There are 3 types of Enemies you&amp;rsquo;ll face in Templetown:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lazy Parasites spawn and stay in a single Zone, laying Eggs in adjacent Intersections.&amp;#10;Wandering Bacteria move between Zones and leave Eggs behind as they go.&amp;#10;And Frankie Bola moves secretly, leaving special Eggs until cornered and revealed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, you are dealt up to 6 Action Cards and by combining them you can optimize your actions: move around the city, construct an Immunity Wall or Cure a Bacteria or a Parasite.&amp;#10;Action cards are used to generate action points (AP), which you&amp;rsquo;ll use on your turn to complete various actions. There are 3 types of AP: (add visual for the 4 action symbols)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Move AP (blue) are used to move between Districts, Intersections, and Zones.&amp;#10;Build AP (green) are used to construct Immunity Blocks and Defense Towers.&amp;#10;And Cure AP (red) are used to remove Enemies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On Action cards, there are 2 symbols, each with a number. These indicate the type and quantity of AP that the card generates. You may use either of the 2 symbols, but not both.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Action cards with a &amp;ldquo;wild&amp;rdquo; symbol may be used as any type of AP.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

They can communicate only in gestures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The monkey in the middle must interpret the gestures of the monkey who can't speak and relay them to the monkey who can't see so that they can build the structure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The monkey who can't see is the only one who can touch the pieces, but they must play the game with their eyes closed. They are responsible for building the structure, based on the directions given to them by the monkey in the middle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each version of TEAM3 comes with a different set of blueprints and a mini expansion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This would appear to be a traditional two player abstract strategy game from Africa.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It was well enough known in the Ivory Coast for that country to issue a set of two postage stamps featuring the game on 11 August 1984 [SG 810-811 / Scott 720-721; designed by Didier / Edila].  Curiously, however, no other information seems to be available on it except from these stamps, and it is not mentioned in any of the major games books in my possession, including that by L'H&amp;ocirc;te, who is usually a good source for games of the Francophone world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is played by two people, on a board similar to that of Nine men's Morris, that is to say, there are 24 playing spaces arranged on the corners and mid-points of the edges of three concentric squares.  However, no diagonals are marked, and the spaces consists of holes, into which the players insert black and white sticks.  One of the stamps shows Eklan being played on an apparently traditional board fashioned into a small table, similar to those used in quality Go or Mancala sets.  The dimensions I give below have been estimated from those pictures (the depth being the approximate height of the illustrated table).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is shown as having a narrow raised 'lip' around its edges, except at open at the corners.  The part of the board between this lip and the outermost set of eight holes is coloured beige, and the regions within it are respectively coloured white, green, and - at the centre - yellow.  Presumably these details are merely decorative.  The sticks would seem to protrude about 6 centimetres out from their holes, and the white ones slant towards one player, while the black ones slant towards his opponent who sits opposite.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>An apparently traditional game from Poland, where it is known as kr&amp;#196;&amp;#153;gle szachowe.  No accepted English name has been found for it, but the words &amp;quot;kr&amp;#196;&amp;#153;gle szachowe&amp;quot; can be translated as &amp;quot;chess bowling&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;chess bowling pins&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Lech Pijanowski, a Polish games expert, described it as a &amp;ldquo;folk game&amp;rdquo; known in Germany and Scandinavia.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played between two players (termed White and Black), who sit opposite each other across a 9&amp;times;9 checkerboard, with a line drawn around the central clock of 3&amp;times;3 squares.  The source illustrates this with dark squares in each corner.  Each player has nine undifferentiated pieces or stones.  Initially, each player places one of his pieces in the corner square to his right, and the other eight complete a square with the first piece as its corner.  White starts, and play is then alternate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Pieces move a single space, to any of the (maximum of) four diagonally adjacent squares.  Capturing is by custodianship, which is to say that an unbroken diagonal line of (one or more) enemy pieces, terminating with a friendly piece at one end of the line, will be captured if a second friendly piece is moved onto the space at the opposite end of the line.  [The source is silent on whether such a move can capture lines of enemy pieces in more than one direction].  Unusually, though, captured pieces do not vacate the board, but are placed elsewhere on the board on a vacant space chosen by the captor, with the restriction that the new space must be the same colour as that from which it was removed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of the game is to complete a previously agreed arrangement of ones own pieces in the marked central sector of the board.  Six examples of winning arrangements are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-o-   ooo   --o   ooo   --o   o-o   &amp;#10;ooo   o-o   --o   ooo   -o-   ---&amp;#10;-o-   ooo   ooo   ooo   o--   o-o&amp;#10;(where o represents a friendly piece, and - an empty square).  &amp;#10;Arrangements involving more pieces are harder to achieve and will make for a longer game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Learning to read in an exciting race: Who is scurrying stealthily through the bookshelf and nibbling on all the pages? A reading rat, of course! In this fast-paced educational game, ABC shooters take up the pursuit of the greedy rodent and learn very easily how to read and understand texts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To stop the voracious reading rat, all players have to read different task cards together. If they have understood the text correctly, they can slide the matching images together on the Turn game board. However, this must be done before the rat has gnawed its way through the shelf. Reading beginners from the age of 6 are just right here. The tasks come in two difficulty levels, so this entertaining learning game can be improved from time to time.&amp;#10;In the race against the reading rat, children immerse themselves in the world of letters, words and their pronunciation. This makes the game a welcome addition to school learning or the ideal preparation for it. Its great pedagogical value derives from the use of the Mildenberger syllable method, which has proven its worth many times over. The syllables highlighted in colour on the text cards lead to a faster comprehension of a word. If it is read syllable by syllable, a word sounds as we have heard it before. Children learn in this way spielerisch that reading makes fun and is not at all so difficult.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Great reading fun with pedagogical demands&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Improves text comprehension in scalable difficulty levels&amp;#10;     Increases the joy of learning and motivates teamwork&amp;#10;     According to the syllable method of Mildenberger&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Im spannenden Wettlauf das Lesen lernen: Wer huscht denn da verstohlen durchs B&amp;uuml;cherregal und knabbert alle Seiten an? Nat&amp;uuml;rlich eine Lese-Ratte! Bei diesem rasanten Lernspiel nehmen ABC-Sch&amp;uuml;tzen die Verfolgung des gierigen Nagetiers auf und lernen kinderleicht, wie das geht mit dem Lesen und Verstehen von Texten.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Um die gefr&amp;auml;&amp;szlig;ige Lese-Ratte zu stoppen, m&amp;uuml;ssen alle Spieler zusammen verschiedene Aufgabenkarten lesen. Wenn sie den Text richtig verstanden haben, k&amp;ouml;nnen sie die passenden Bilder auf dem Wende-Spielplan zusammenschieben. Das muss allerdings gelingen, bevor sich die Ratte durchs Regal genagt hat. Lese-Einsteiger ab 6 Jahren sind hier genau richtig. Die Aufgaben gibt es in zwei Schwierigkeitsstufen, sodass sich dieses unterhaltsame Lernspiel von Mal zu Mal steigern l&amp;auml;sst.&amp;#10;Beim Wettlauf mit der Lese-Ratte tauchen Kinder tief in die Welt der Buchstaben, W&amp;ouml;rter und ihrer Aussprache ein. Damit ist das Spiel eine willkommene Erg&amp;auml;nzung zum schulischen Lernen oder die ideale Vorbereitung darauf. Seinen gro&amp;szlig;en p&amp;auml;dagogischen Wert erh&amp;auml;lt es aus der Anwendung der vielfach bew&amp;auml;hrten Mildenberger Silbenmethode. Die auf den Textkarten farbig hervorgehobenen Silben f&amp;uuml;hren zum schnelleren Erfassen eines Wortes. Wird es n&amp;auml;mlich silbenweise gelesen, klingt ein Wort so, wie wir es schon einmal geh&amp;ouml;rt haben. Kinder lernen auf diese Weise spielerisch, dass Lesen Spa&amp;szlig; macht und gar nicht mal so schwer ist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ein gro&amp;szlig;er Lesespa&amp;szlig; mit p&amp;auml;dagogischem Anspruch&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Verbessert das Textverst&amp;auml;ndnis in skalierbaren Schwierigkeitsstufen&amp;#10;     Steigert die Freude am Lernen und motiviert zur Teamarbeit&amp;#10;     Nach der Silbenmethode von Mildenberger&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

World leadership came together to build a massive flotilla, mankind's last bastion of civilization.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Flotilla, you are a fleet commander who is trying to bring prosperity to humanity's new home. You'll explore the new face of the ocean, salvage whatever you can from the depths, build your crew, and gain influence with the governing guilds. If you do well enough, you might be able to take what you've gathered and add it to the flotilla itself by attaching your watercraft. Your goal is to become the most influential figure in the flotilla and lead civilization into a new era.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flotilla features two distinct modes of gameplay linked with an innovative system. Players begin the game as Sinksiders, mostly exploring for resources, but can &amp;quot;turn&amp;quot; Skyside at any time to work on expanding the flotilla by flipping many of your game components over to fill a different role for the rest of the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

One or more players will create their own Federation captains, form a task force, and work together to defeat the Dominion over a series of campaign missions. This box contains everything one or two players need to play the full campaign, including pre-painted plastic ships, custom dice, cards, tokens, and a six-mission campaign book. With multiple copies of this set, up to six players can fight the Dominion together!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During each mission, players battle against enemy ships controlled by the game, while completing objectives to earn experience points. Between missions, players spend experience points to upgrade their ships and advance the overall campaign, building their captain into a Starfleet legend!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Star Trek: Alliance ships and upgrades from this set are compatible with Star Trek: Attack Wing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

But the market for artifacts can shift like the rains of Africa: One minute, treasures from a lost pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s pyramid are all the  rage with collectors, and the next minute religious artifacts discovered in a remote temple are what&amp;rsquo;s in demand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Curios, players acquire artifacts from various treasure sites without knowing their worth. Using the cards in your hand and those revealed by others, you can deduce the possible value of your artifacts, allowing you to focus your efforts on the more profitable ventures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Curios is a game of worker placement, deduction, and bluffing like no other. This simple and intuitive game is quick to learn and even quicker to play!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>You are a Margrave charged with defending the borders of a province in Valeria. Position yourself around the map to command knights, slay monsters, hire citizens, ship goods, and build mighty Ward Towers in order to gain influence over the 4 Guilds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you may either move your Margrave to activate the locations action and then deploy knights - OR - play a citizen card from your hand to activate its power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 8 locations in Margraves, each with a unique action: &amp;#10;Kamin - Gather stone. &amp;#10;Prima - Hire citizens (cards) from the display.&amp;#10;Thraecius - Pay 3 resources to gain a Ward Gem.&amp;#10;Silesia - Pay 1 Gold to gain 1 Resource. &amp;#10;Ny'mar - Pay resources to move your Ship around the track. &amp;#10;Inkadeus - Gain wood.&amp;#10;Viktoria - Gain strength.&amp;#10;Reykstrom - Gain magic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You start the game with 6 citizens in your hand. When you play the citizen, it stays on the table until you play your Herald to recall all cards to your hand. As you hire more citizens, your play options increase. New citizens are also tied to the Guilds and will score you points at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The main goal of the game is to gain influence over the 4 Guilds. The more influence you have over them, the more victory points you will score for each of their icons that you collect throughout the game. Will you be able to defend the borders and gain enough influence to win the title of Duke or Duchess of the province?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

You can place them in front of other players to limit their/block their movements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you reach your sick friend first you will win, but if the Brutelaar does, everybody loses!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game can be played solo. There are 5 normal player tokens. With a six-player count, one person can take on the role of the evil Brutelaar.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

It is a push-your-luck party game where you play as a new user to the dating app everyone has been talking about Dating Pool.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player gets a User Card that (1) has a number that affects player order and scoring and (2) a Reputation Power that can be used once per Round to gain additional benefits.  In intermediate and advanced modes, players also get a hidden Personality Card which gives them secret objectives and powers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start the Round by drawing from the Dating Pool Deck.  When a Profile Card is draw, the highest ranked User can either match or pass.  If the User passes, the next highest ranked User decides to match or pass, and so on.  Be careful who you match with: once you're matched, you can't pick up a new card if someone better comes along.  Breakup cards make you break up with your match if they are too far above your User Card. Players continue play until a &amp;quot;No Matches Nearby&amp;quot; card is drawn when certain conditions are met.  Your score is your Match minus your User score, so the higher your User score, the higher priority you get in matching, but also the more points you lose at the end of the Round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dating Pool is played over a series of rounds, with the lowest scoring player given first choice to choose their new User Card.  The first player to 50 points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>GladiGala is a 2-4 player skirmish style family game of fast paced tactics and simultaneous play &amp;ndash; a tactical rush for fame &amp;amp; fortune.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In GladiGala players take the role of gladiator school leaders who meet in the arena for a day of a tactical show off. Your objective is to finish the day (after playing 2 matches, morning and afternoon) as the most decorated gladiator school of Rome, and winner of the day! Players can achieve this in 2 ways: either capture an opponent's Eagle (and receive Medal of Eagle), or by having the most denarii (GladiGala's coins) in your Treasury as a match ends (receive Medal of Coin). In GladiGala all the results of what happens in the arena are translated into coins, by which players can also manage their gladiator team during the match (upgrade a hurt gladiator, create advanced maneuvers, or enter the arena's &amp;quot;Safe Zone&amp;quot;).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a Gladiator School Leader it is up to you to gain coins and fill your Treasury for marvelous tactical performances and for making accurate strategic choices. Outwit your opponents, make the most of your gladiators' formation, manage your Treasury wisely, and get the crowds on your side chanting GladiGala's mantra: &amp;quot;Always aim for an eagle &amp;ndash; always stand guard!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GladiGala is a simultaneous game played in multiple rounds. First, players use magnetic panels/cards to give movements, maneuvering, and action orders to all gladiators. Each game players enter the arena with a different gladiator formation, made from GladiGala's 4 gladiator types: Sword, Spear, Dagger, and Club, each has a different set of abilities. After giving movements orders, players place their attacks trying to anticipate their opponent's moves. Finally, cards are revealed and all gladiators perform accordingly. A gladiator moving to an attacked area is marked as &amp;quot;Hit&amp;quot;. A gladiator hit twice is out of the arena!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to Rome, 101 A.D.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The city's center stage is set up and ready for GladiGala, the year's greatest show of skill in the arena.  Rome's 4 finest Gladiator Schools; ACADEMIA &amp;ndash; LEO &amp;ndash; SOLIS &amp;amp; SPIRITUS &amp;ndash; appear in the arena for a glorious day of tactical contest in the pursuit of title and Medal of Champion!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Morning rises and the crowds make their way to the arena. The teams all gear up, final preparations are made, last instructions are given. Your gladiator formation for the morning match is set and ready to head out the gate. Your gladiators are holding to their eagle, your house symbol of honor and respect. You hope they will be holding it to the end&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trumpets are blown, the crowds are ecstatic: &amp;quot;open the gates!&amp;quot; you hear them shouting, frantic.  GladiGala begins: Shlak Shlak Shlak &amp;ndash; all gates are raised announcing it's time to storm Rome's most celebrated central stage!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Peach Snaps is a juicy game of fast reactions. Set up the game by dealing out the entire pack of cards equally between the number of players and leaving one card in the middle to start the snap pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player must then draw the top 3 cards from their respective&amp;#10;draw piles to create their hand (make sure the other players don&amp;rsquo;t see your hand). Snap down any card from your hand onto the centre piles each time there's a match by colour , symbol or number. Only when you have used all three cards in your hand are you able to draw a new hand. Everyone plays at once in a furiously fast race to get rid of their cards fast.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To make things even more fun, there are action cards throughout the pack - a freeze card, a new peachy pile card and a clear hand pile. Any card can be played on top of an action card.&amp;#10;When you play the freeze card you are then able to nominate any player who then can not play until 5 cards have been played in the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The new peachy pile card allows you to start another brand new pile in addition the the main snap pile.&amp;#10;If the clear hand card is among the three cards in your hand you are able to discard your entire hand onto the snap pile with the clear hand card on top.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player with no cards left wins by saying 'Peach Snaps!'&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>You&amp;rsquo;ve never really had any grand super villain ambitions. Nah, that's not your thing. You're just an honest contractor trying to get by, only without scruples and not overly concerned with safety precautions or work conditions. You take a very special kind of pride in always running in head first, literally, no questions asked. Just enjoying the thrill of the moment and the luxury of not having to make plans further ahead than a couple of hours. What&amp;rsquo;s so terribly wrong about that?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Goons is a strategy board game for 2-4 players that combines character development, action selection and gambling mechanism in a very special way. In Goons players will be trying out a new thrilling career as henchmen! Throwing themselves right into the heat of the fire and joining in on different villains wacky schemes. The goal is to earn as much cash as possible, get the snazziest gear and rise in respect with the local villains. Perhaps someday, you&amp;rsquo;ll finally be the one calling the shots!?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On players turn they will choose their actions by using an action selection system that lets them draw action tiles from an ongoing scoring grid, combining them with another action, by covering spaces up on their goon board. Actions include going to the gym to increase your energy, shopping for new gear, earn a little extra as a dishwasher and mixing things up at the night club.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But most importantly, players will commit to different daring villain schemes by placing energy markers on them to increase the chances of success and reward. Each villain in the game has a unique theme and scoring mechanics, so players will carefully have to consider which ones to support.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goon with the most victory points at the end of the game wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The players try to increase their influence in three nations in four rounds with a play time of 40 minutes per player.&amp;#10;The players sail on a round course through the Caribbean. E.g., you have city tiles where you are able to perform various&amp;nbsp;actions or deliver goods to. One special feature is an implemented quest mode over more and various tiles, which tells the player, who chase after it, a little story. &amp;#10;As a player, you move with your ship around the course, managing it by using cards like in other games from Alexander Pfister.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;revised user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Apex Portal presents Lost Plateau, inspired by the 1912 classic novel, The Lost World, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  On this secret plateau, dinosaurs roam a land of volcanoes and treacherous cliffs.  Expeditions navigate stampeding dinosaurs while chasing eggs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dinosaurs! At Apex Portal we love primal physical mechanics.    We evolved Lost Plateau for over 10 years. This design strived for 2 goals to produce primal tension.  First, to have dinosaurs with an elegant set of behaviors (stampede, defensive facing, double dino combinations) to capture opposing dinosaurs.  Second, to balance the influence of the 2 entities, the expedition and the dinosaur, so both are always in consideration for their way of scoring and interacting between each other.  You control a herd and an expedition.  The dino behaviors are truly predatorial for a fun tactical level game.  When will your expedition feel safe to make a run the gauntlet of opposing dinos for the eggs?  That question and getting your herd to the high ground is the strategy side of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Description&amp;#10;   This is a physical primal game.&amp;#10;   A player turn is 2 actions &amp;ndash; may do the same action twice.&amp;#10;Move Expedition Action &amp;ndash; Pick up and deliver eggs to the Safe Camps.  Using the in-game Trail Blaze expansion allows unlimited movement on established trails that can be co-developed between competitors.&amp;#10;Move Dinosaur Action &amp;ndash;  Dinos stampede dinos and opposing expeditions.  The dino is moved and then given facing to prevent stampede from one direction.  If both actions are Move Dino then sly double dino stampedes appear out of the mist!  This encourages dinos to stay within reach of herd mates and maximizes true predator mind set &amp;ndash;  you always see opportunity, but often don't see the other herd coming after you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning the game&amp;nbsp;- Score 6 total eggs and/or dino captures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two unique team versions for 4 to 6 player.  Can play as team mates or as competing &amp;ldquo;herd mates&amp;rdquo;.  Herd mates both control and share the points scored by their herd, but don't share in egg scoring.  The team games are also unique for the speed of play.  A 6 player game runs!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trail Blaze Expansion. The in-game expansion adds a 3rd action, for experienced gamers.  Each player or team has 20 blazes to use.  The action is the placing of 5 blazes on any spaces of the board.  The Expeditions may move into any space that is adjacent and has at least 2 Blazes and at least one is of the player's color.  The Trail Blaze markers make it so players have intense interaction between dinos and expeditions and adds co-opetition to jump in on other player's trails.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Each player in Croco Rider has twelve discs that they lay out in a circle on their half of the game board. These discs have values from 1 to 6 and from -1 to -6. The game board shows five crocodiles on it, with the crocodiles having 3-7 spaces on them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To start the game, a player places one of their discs on an empty crocodile space. The next player chooses a disc and places it on an empty space, whether on the same crocodile or a different one. On each subsequent turn, a player can play either disc from the open end of their circle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a crocodile has two face-up discs on it, whether of the same or different colors, one of those discs is turned face down. If both discs are positive or negative, the disc closer to the crocodile's head wins and the other one is turned face down; if one disc is positive and the other negative, then the disc closer to the tail wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all the pieces have been placed, the game ends. Whoever has their disc face up on a crocodile scores points for that disc, with the value being equal to the number on the disc (1-6) multiplied by the position of the disc on the crocodile from the tail forward. If the crocodile has four spaces, for example, and you have a 3 near the crocodile's head, then you score 12 points for it (3 x 4 for the fourth space on the crocodile). Whoever has the higher score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The game board in Anacund is composed of 17 wooden slats; fifteen of these slats have an ideogram at either end, with these ideograms representing the numbers 1-6. Shuffle these slats, then place them in a row, then place the remaining two slats (each with three ideograms) on either end to create a single path of 36 spaces. One of these spaces is colored red and dubbed the &amp;quot;bonus square&amp;quot;. Each player takes 18 of the double-sided tokens, then places them in three groups of six, with their color face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, you must place three of your tokens on the game board. The space that you place a token on must equal the number of tokens in the group before you placed that token. Thus, at the start of the game, you take a token from a group of six tokens, then place that token on a 6 space. Your next token must be placed on a 5 (if taken from the same group) or a 6 (if taken from one of your remaining two groups).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If after placing a token, you have sandwiched one or more of the opponent's tokens, those opposing tokens are flipped over and placed next to the spaces they once occupied. These spaces cannot be played in again. If you would create a sandwich with yourself in the middle, then your own pieces are captured &amp;mdash; unless you have simultaneously sandwiched the opponent at the same time, in which case you capture them instead.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all the pieces have been placed, players tally their scores. Each piece showing your color, whether on the board or next to it, is worth 1 point; whoever has a piece on or next to the bonus space scores 5 points. Whoever has the higher score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Abyss Conspiracy, which is not necessarily the game's final name, is a card game set in the world of Abyss.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The card deck in the game consists of cards in five colors, with twelve of each color and cards numbered 0-6. Each player in the game drafts cards and builds a reverse pyramid, starting with a row of five cards, then placing four cards in a row below that, then three under that, etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, you can draw 1-3 cards from the deck, choose one of those cards and add it to your current row, then place any remaining cards grouped by color near the deck; alternatively, you can pick up all the cards of a color next to the deck and add them to your current row.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as the cards in your rows show two matching keys or three different keys, you take either the revealed location card or the top card of the location deck, and place it on the lattermost card with a key. Location cards increase the value of a card and sometimes have special powers. Some cards feature pearls, and when you have as many or more pearls as whoever has the pearl majority card, you take this card from them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends as soon as someone finishes their pyramid, then all players score their points. For each color, you score points equal to the largest valued card in your pyramid. Additionally, for each color, you look at the largest grouping of cards in your pyramid and you score 3 points for each of those cards. Whoever held the pearl majority card at game's end scores 5 points for it. Whoever has the highest score wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Tyr is a fickle god, creating in his image and then forsaking his children when their reflection does not paint him favorably. Among all of the creators, Tyr&amp;rsquo;s universe is the most volatile, competitive, and in turn, the most interesting. The other divinities searched and have found a way to hide from Tyr&amp;rsquo;s Judge, each leaving small traces of themselves in his world. This has not gone unnoticed; Tyr allows their interference to enhance his Trials and test the mettle of his creations. Savor your favor, it may not last long.&amp;#10; Raid Boss: Incarnate is a 4-player cooperative boss battle designed to feel like an MMORPG dungeon encounter with all of the teamwork, strategy, and collaboration, but none of the endless grinding!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You control a Hero with a mechanically distinct and heavily themed set of abilities. Each Hero has an Assist that can be used at ANY time -- including other players&amp;rsquo; turns! Gather your team to face off against stalwart, quirky, and skill-testing Bosses that come equipped with their own special deck of cards. &amp;#10;Raid Boss has flexibility that allows you to devise incredibly clever skill sequences. Game-ending threats soon become trivial as you experiment and gain experience, allowing you to tackle devious and puzzle-like advanced Bosses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 12 Heroes and 6 Bosses, each lavishly illustrated, giving you a wealth of content and variety of challenges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Have you ever wondered what comes after the zombie apocalypse? What might society look like in a world where the undead are a threat to the living, but where their presence is just an aspect of life?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What We Became is a board game for 4 to 8 players that explores these questions. Players take on the role of community leaders, each of them with a specific vision of what their society could be. They will need to work together to keep the community safe, erect new buildings, and instill new ways of doing things among the populace, but always remembering that none of the other players shares their exact vision.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What We Became is highly competitive, but the environment presents enough of a threat that players will need to negotiate and work together with adversaries to stay alive, all while trying to outmaneuver them to come out ahead. At the end of each game, you will realize that a story has been told about the ups, downs, successes, and failures of a community decades after the world as we know it has ceased to exist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>As an engineer in Alien Comms you are here to establish a new Telecommunications Station on a small satellite in a galaxy far away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Alien Comms, each turn you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets from which every player chooses one. On one side you will find an Alien faction and an antenna model; on the other side, an Alien extension number and a energy adapter. You mark the chosen Alien Extension on it&amp;acute;s Alien faction and the Antenna Model on their tracks. Then you draw the antenna model and the energy adapter on an empty spot on your satellite.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But, what am I going to do with all of these antennas? Well... connect them to the Astronomic Entities, of course! There might be others trying to do the same as you and in these times it is known that nobody will buy the &amp;quot;second&amp;quot; quickest connection... Since actions are taken at the same time, all players can claim their connection to an Astronomic Entities on the same turn, but not on the next &amp;iexcl;so be quick to claim them before it is too late!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each day a new galaxy is discovered and many are waiting to be the first ones to establish a contact there... Will you be the next?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
