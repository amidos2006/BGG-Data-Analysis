						               													<description>Solitaire, print and play game. The Hero must inflict 8 wounds on the dragon before the dragon inflicts 4 wounds on the Hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board shows the body of the dragon, divided in boxes with target numbers in them. The player places Aim cubes to indicate the area the Hero is targeting, and rolls dice. An aim cube must be removed to reroll the dice, narrowing the area that can be hit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After rolling, the player uses the dice to attack the dragon and/or cast spells.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next, the player rolls to determine the type of attack the dragon will perform, and resolves that attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game continues until either the Hero or the dragon is dead. It *is* possible that they will both die in the same turn, ending the game in a tragic tie.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Early colonization efforts of Mars have been successful. With dozens of outposts scattered across the surface, a new challenge awaits: providing infrastructure to the red planet and moving goods to where they are needed most (while making a tidy profit of course). Fortunately the abundance of precious metals will help with this task by allowing upgrades to the transport vessels over time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tracks on Mars is a light-weight family crayon rail game. It has been designed specifically for two players. Drawing the tracks, loading goods onto the pawns, and over sized dice all work together to make this a very tactile experience. Luck is a major factor but can be mitigated by re-rolls and catch-up mechanics. On a strategic level, players have to balance network building, transportation, and equipment upgrades.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The core mechanics are Yahtzee-style dice rolling and resource allocation. Matching dice rolls are converted to currency which is then used to either claim new routes or move the player's pawns to pick up and deliver goods. Victory points are ultimately  scored depending on the distance that goods have been transported. Players have to decide whether they want to make multiple short runs for few VPs or spend turns building a long route for fewer high value transports.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a print &amp;amp; play title comprised of five dice, 40 resource cubes, currency token cards, an 18&amp;quot; x 18&amp;quot; board, and four 3D printed pawns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Come back in space and time, now you are in the Mexico of 1910, Porfirio Diaz has been in power for more than 30 years. With the slogan &amp;quot;Order and Progress&amp;quot; the country has been brought to modernity, electricity is implemented in cities, train lines are spread throughout the Republic, foreign investment appears everywhere and the exchange rate of the Mexican peso It is equal to the american dollar.&amp;#10;But ... on the other hand, the peasants live in deplorable conditions, outrageous laws are stripped of their land and then hired to work as salaried employees, the dismayed people observe how the political contenders are repressed and the new reelection is prepared.&amp;#10;The Flores Magon brothers use the press to express the dissatisfaction of the people and Francisco I. Madero prepares an uprising with the phrase &amp;quot;effective suffrage, no re-election&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;Tierra y Libertad is a cooperative game, take a place at the table, you will take the role of one of the rebel factions and together they will try to change the Constitution of the country so that it includes the demands of the people.&amp;#10;To achieve this, notable revolutionaries will join your faction, you will also need plans that represent historical events, which are activated with resources (troops, weapons, revolutionary ideas and political power) that you get in different regions of Mexico. The combats are the order of the day, and the actions of the factions do not always help the cause. Players should carefully plan their planning so as not to be crushed by the conservative machinery.&amp;#10;If the players manage to reach the fourth round and also all together make 100 or more victory points then they will have won as a team and a new and inclusive Constitution will now govern the country's destiny.&amp;#10;Otherwise, if objectives of victory points are not met at the end of each round or at the end of the fourth round the factions do not reach or pass the 100 victory points then the counterrevolutionaries will have won, the flame of the Revolution will be extinguished and the course to prosperity will be conducted with the rules of yesteryear.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is a new take on the collectible non-collectible KB line, with Jeffrey Neil Bellinger once again putting the rabbits through the grinder. Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ultimate Odyssey is not collectible or random. Players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is a new take on the collectible non-collectible KB line, with Jeffrey Neil Bellinger once again putting the rabbits through the grinder. Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ultimate Odyssey is not collectible or random. Players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Green deck has a Crops based theme which also includes fruits, vegetables and marvelous cards such as Transplanted Troop which allows players to steal bunnies and Reversal Of Order which helps dictate the order of card play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>When a tree is old enough, it starts to make flowers. The flower is a message from the tree to you, the pollinators. Calling you to come by day and by night &amp;ndash; to drink its nectar, to pick up its pollen grains, and to transport these to another tree of the same species.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Because it&amp;rsquo;s ready to breed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over each of the four levels different trees send out differing messages in their flowers. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to work together to complete each level, moving as the elements allow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As flowers pollinated by you (or the wind) become seeds or berries, teams can collect the resulting berries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Locally made, with recycled materials and FSC card&amp;#10;&amp;#10;LEVEL A: Pick up and drop off&amp;#10;LEVEL B: One way trip&amp;#10;LEVEL C: Passing through&amp;#10;LEVEL D: Counting the load&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flight of Pollen is a semi-cooperative game where you pollinate as many trees as possible by visiting them with a variety of different New Zealand pollinators, with different pollinators being more successful under different weather conditions.  Rounds are split into day and night segments, with different pollinators active during the day versus the night.  Each pollinator must move from one plant to the next of the same species, moving pollen between them until all of the plants of the target species are pollinated- if any are missed, the game is lost.  One or more different native New Zealand plant are the focus for each of the four rounds, and as the rounds progress more pollinator species are added, as well as more plant species with more challenging pollination requirements.  If all of the required plants have been pollinated, then the team that collected the most berries wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Welcome to the Trollz World! Join the Best Friends for Life as they scoot all around Trollzopolis collecting Gem tokens. But watch out for Snarf--Simon's half dog, half ogre sidekick--or he'll slow down your quest to defeat Simon!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To get around, players roll a die. Pimple Spell spaces and Snarf spaces can limit players' movement but can be gotten around with Obsidian tokens and Obsidian Spell Phone tokens, which can reroll dice or use the spell phone instead of rolling. Other spaces can call every player to a specific space. The Spell Phone included with the game decides what happens when it's landed on or rolled via a text message that appears on the screen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective is to be the first player to collect all 5 Gem tokens and defeat Simon in the final showdown.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Based on the Trollz toyline and cartoon by DiC Entertainment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Then you use your rolled dice to attack a part of the monster you were targeting, or to activate a spell.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next, a die roll is used to determine which attack the hydra uses against you, and a second die roll to resolve that attack.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Continue until you kill the hydra, or the hydra kills your hero.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>5 Stack is an exciting chip stacking game with the perfect mixture of strategy and chance. 5 Stack is simple enough that a 5-year-old can play it and interesting enough to captivate the seasoned board game veteran.  Proudly made in the USA, components include a game board, coloured wooden chips, dice, scoring pad, and instructions.  Designed by Jackson Robinson, and published by Kings Wild Project.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To set-up: Players all get 25 chips in their colour plus a single gold coin, and dice are rolled for a random set-up that adds five chips per player to a 6x6 game-board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To play: In clockwise order players take turns to: (a) move a chip or a chip stack of their colour in a straight direction on the board; (b) place a new chip with the location determined by a dice roll. The game ends when someone has played all their chips and cleared all chip stacks under their control.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win: The aim of the game is to score the highest number of points.  Points are scored by clearing a stack (when a stack under your control reaches 5 or more chips, with gold chips being worth 5 instead of 1 point each).  Your final score is the total number of &amp;quot;cleared&amp;quot; chips minus any of your unplayed and uncleared chips at game end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

You have to decode the secret code which you received from the command and you must obtain secret information about Frist Order&amp;rsquo;s plans. &amp;#10;In the game you will be playing  as Rey, Poe, Finn and Rose. Who will be the first to complete the mission? May the force be with you!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to collect three white and three black information markers. At the moment when the first player puts the last of the six markers on his/hers  the character board, the game ends immediately and the player wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round of the game is divided into two parts: coding and gaining information. In the first part, players set up their code as quickly as possible to determine in what order players will take turns and how many actions they will have. In the second part, they do as much actions as they get after the first round: you can move your pawn, explore squares, rotate them, and gain information markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Nightfighter Ace, Air Defense Over Germany, 1943-44 is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a German Nightfighter during World War II. Each turn consists of several days, during which a combat mission will be flown from one of many bases in Europe, attempting to intercept incoming British Bombers. Nightfighter Ace is based on the popular, action-packed Hunters game system by Gregory M. Smith with a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion and receive awards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a German Nightfighter pilot and rack up kills. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request a transfer to other nightfighter bases in an attempt to get &amp;quot;closer to the action&amp;quot; or request a newer type of nightfighter. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player's eventual goal &amp;ndash; to become the top nightfighter ace of the war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>At the beginning of the game, each opponent rolls the general/captain and places him in the captain&amp;rsquo;s area(Three circles). Then place the tie breaker die(clear with a small blue die inside it) in the tiebreaker area(5 circles) To start out each player rolls 2 of their dice and places them in the first row. Then the player can choose to either keep his/her row and try his/her luck or they can lower a die&amp;rsquo;s number by one and roll another die. The objective is to have a higher sum for each row than your opponent. The max capacity for each row is five die. At the end of the turn both players add up the die and the larger number is subtracted from the lower number. Next the Difference is taken away from the losing army. If a tie is to occur then the clear die with a blue die in it is rolled by each player and the sum of the two die is added to each player&amp;rsquo;s side based on the roll. Keep doing this until there is no tie. If you have a one in your row at the end of a turn change the one to a six before you add up. If you end up calculating before changing the one to a six the one stays a one for the remainder of the game. If you lose then you can roll the 20 sided die and re roll the captain. Place the same number of added die to your side of the military and try to beat your opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Things to remember: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     If you roll a one with your general, it stays a one&amp;#10;     Lower each die one at a time&amp;#10;     The game stops after you completely lose all of your die and roll the failure die&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Baby is cooperative deduction micro game for two to three players in which one player facilitates the recurring and semi-random needs of the infant whilst the other one (or two) player(s) take on the role of the parents, attempting to decipher and resolve the cause of their child's cries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game consists of three micro decks of five cards each. One deck represents a happy baby, another a sad baby, and the middle a neutral baby. A baby status token moves between the decks, indicating the current climate of the infant and also defining from which deck the next card should be drawn. Cards are only seen by the player playing the role of the child, and upon them are depicted up to two different needs of the five in the game: hungry, poopie, sleepy, restless and crying wolf (ie. nothing's really wrong). Depending on the card the player will then place face-down tokens showing the baby is upset but not visibly indicating what the cause is. These needs can be resolved with different parent tokens, such as feeding, diapers, carrying, music and playing. While the need tokens don't come in multiples and therefore can't &amp;quot;double up&amp;quot; on the same time the parents only have a limited number of each of their tokens so they must use them wisely. After each step of the game (child expressing and then parents attempting to solve it) the baby status is always move to indicate the new state of the child.

						               													<description>The 18th century in Europe saw a massive development in weapons and tactics. The musket was refined into a flintlock, smoothbore with a socket bayonet. Although accuracy was low, which limited effective fire to very short ranges, volume of fire improved considerably and units were capable of firing three and sometimes four rounds a minute. The infantryman was now capable of combining the roles of musketeer and pikeman in one. And to maximise firepower, formations became wider. The aim was to move a formation to within range of the enemy and then overwhelm them with firepower. Only rarely was a bayonet charge needed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Units of 3 bases represent an infantry battalion or cavalry squadron. Suggested basing sizes are given for 6, 15, and 25/28mm figures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns activating one brigade at a time. Each brigade commander is rated as Poor, Average, or Excellent, which allows the commander to activate 1-3 groups of brigade units. After all brigades have activated, combat occurs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes army lists for various 18th century wars: Great Norther War, American Indian Wars, War of Spanish Succession, Wars Against the Turks, Jacobite Risings, Seven Years War, American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary Wars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In Shoudo, two players face off across the battlefield of the Sengoku Jidai - the Japanese civil war. The players assume control of one of four great clans - Uesugi, Mori, Tokugawa, or Shimazu - and attempt to defeat their opponent to become the Shogun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Shoudo is a terrain-based strategy game. The board, which consists of 40 cards, is shuffled and laid out in a random 5x8 configuration at the start of each game. Each player controls 3 armies which they may use to &amp;quot;burn&amp;quot; enemy lands and attack enemy armies and castles. The first player to destroy their opponent's Daimyo castle wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To win, players must engage in combat. When attacking an enemy army or castle, combat is fought over 3 rounds. Each round, both players roll a 6-sided combat die and add the strength of their unit and its terrain bonus - the higher roll wins the round, and the first player to win 2 rounds wins the combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Special clan abilities, inspired by the traditional clans, affect gameplay, giving each clan a unique advantage. These abilities can give tactical advantage or greater sustainability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Gather your wits, fill your backpack with baits, and venture into the wild to tame mystical creatures before your rivals do! Do you have what it takes to become the best monster tamer?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Menagerie is played over a series of rounds, with each player taking one main action per round. Available actions include filling your backpack with baits, taming a monster, or preparing for a future turn by picking up cards. Players may also try to gain an advantage over their rivals by using the special powers of monsters in their menagerie. The game ends when a player tames at least 8 monsters. The player with the most prestige from monsters and hidden bonus crates is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The turn passes to the next player, who will do likewise with the constraint of storing the card in the drawer below the previous one. The last two toy tiles stay on the table and will be considered as they were put on the floor.&amp;#10;Shuffle toy cards and assemble a card deck. Turn over all the cards, one at a time. All together the players should try to remember where to find that toy: place on the card a shoe tile with the colour of the drawer or with floor face up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now check the actual position of the toys: did you recall where all toys have been placed?

						               													<description>Day 1: It has been confirmed that what is now called &amp;quot;gravity stones&amp;quot; arose last night. Crystalline rock formations levitate in mid-air, resulting in a great decrease in the gravity around them.The potential benefits are enormous and the seven days we have to study them won't be wasted, be sure of it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gravity Stones is a development and optimization game with multiple choices in a brief playing time. The game plays over the course of seven rounds. Each round, a simultaneous first phase allows the players to play cards from their hand on the action side or on the resource side, also discarding one of them onto the central (company)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second phase is individual, and starts with the first player, who uses their actions and resources (if needed) to establish a camp on the mountain, to study the stones, or to construct ZeroG tools from them. Once your actions are spent, you can either recover one of the cards left by the players or leave them; you will be punished or rewarded based on your choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With its intertwined actions and grant system, Gravity Stones allows you to augment your base actions with the stones you get back from the central board. The company that's hired you will also give you objectives to fulfill...or not.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>No Motherland Without is a card-driven strategy game for two players. The game depicts the struggles of the Kim Regime from 1953 to present day North Korea against the West.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the aftermath of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean peninsula divided in two. While its signature marked a cessation of armed conflict, the war was not over. In over six decades since the armistice was signed, three generations of the Kim regime resisted Chinese and Soviet influence, endured floods, famine, isolation and economic sanctions while defiantly pursuing nuclear weapons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One player will be the DPRK (Democratic People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of Korea), seeking a nuclear deterrent to invasion, improving living standards to prevent uprising, and purging elites to prevent a coup.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Another player will be the West, aiding defectors to obtain intel, stymieing the missile program to secure the region, implementing sanctions to impede the North Korean economy and further isolating the DPRK from the global community to intensify pressure on the regime.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Use programmed actions to launch fighters and torpedos, fire lasers, and even unleash your railgun! Every move counts when the cold embrace of space awaits outside...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players control two battlecruisers fighting across an imaginary grid of 3x2 cards. Weapons are played into the columns and move over to the opponent's cruiser in an attempt to cause damage. Each player has a command queue that they load cards into the back of and execute from the front of. This queue is played face up so your opponent has an idea of what you intend to do, but each card has two options so you are never sure what is going to happen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It works like a two-player space invaders, with weapon cards moving across the space between cruisers and causing damage if they reach the other side. With only three hit points for each cruiser, it is intended to be a quick dueling game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In Space Base, players assume the roles of Commodores of a small fleet of ships. Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command. Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence. Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence. Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core &amp;quot;I roll, everyone gets stuff&amp;quot; mechanism seen in other games. It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach. Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Mont&amp;eacute;limar: Anvil of Fate, On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded the South of France in Operation Dragoon. Major General Truscott's U.S. VI Corps landed along a 45 mile stretch of French Coast with the objective of isolating the major German forces defending the western part of France and linking up with the Normandy forces breaking out of their beachhead. The southern beachhead would be secured in only 2 days and the Americans were well established inland. With scattered and only occasionally strong resistance, the Americans and now landed French advanced north up the Rhone valley along highway N-7 &amp;mdash; heading quickly toward the key rail and road junction at Aix-en-Provence. This was captured on August 19th. At this point, General Truscott activated a provisional force called Task Force Butler. This roughly regimentally sized unit raced ahead of the main force with the objective of capturing the main route of escape for the German Army. The Task Force set up a defensive position in the high ground to the north of Mont&amp;eacute;limar. They were to hold until relieved. The Germans would throw everything they could at Task Force Butler in a race to return to Germany before the larger Allied Formations coming up from the south and east would join Task Force Butler.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the end, both sides could claim victory &amp;mdash; the Allies mauled the enemy forces with the Germans suffering 2100 casualties with several thousand soldiers and large amounts of heavy equipment unable to escape. The Allies suffered only 1200 casualties but much of the German Army did get away and a great opportunity was lost.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mont&amp;eacute;limar: Anvil of Fate is the third game in the Company Scale System and the first game in the Liberation series covering battles in Western Europe in 1944 and 1945. This game, while sharing a similar system to both Saipan: The Bloody Rock and Guam: Return to Glory , will offer a completely different feel to how it plays.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Game Turn: 2 hours (daytime)/ 4-6 hours (nighttime)&amp;#10;Hex: 500 meters / 547 yards (3/10 of a mile)&amp;#10;Units: Company&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;Five 22 x 34&amp;quot; full color mapsheets&amp;#10;Six dual-side printed countersheet (1,056 5/8&amp;quot; counters)&amp;#10;One 40-page Mont&amp;eacute;limar rulebook&amp;#10;One 56-page Mont&amp;eacute;limar scenario book&amp;#10;One Sequence of Play chart&amp;#10;One Time/Date/Weather/VP chart&amp;#10;Two CRT/TEC charts&amp;#10;Four Divisional Display charts&amp;#10;Two 10-sided die&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Playability: High&amp;#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&amp;#10;Players: 2 or more&amp;#10;Playing Time: 4-50 hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Postcard Dungeons (a tiny game of small adventures) is a casual and extremely portable board game for 2-6 players (although it can be played solo). Dice and tokens for the game are not included and must be supplied by the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game simulates a series of dungeon crawls in search of treasure. Players represent the leaders of various adventuring guilds who choose from one of 3 dungeons that have increasing levels of challenge. They then roll 3D6 to populate the dungeon. After the dungeon is set up, they roll another 3D6 to determine the strength of their party which is made up of a Thief, a Warrior and a Wizard. They choose which die goes to which hero and play progresses between the dungeon taking a turn against the player and the player taking a turn against the dungeon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Depending on how well a particular adventure goes, the player may be able to purchase a treasure from a list based on the dungeon they chose. Players may choose between treasures that add to victory points, or will give them a magical advantage in the next dungeon adventure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
