						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Murder on the Millennium -Or- Who's Killing Time?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's the turn of the Century, and you're standing on the brink of a whole new Millennium. What an exciting time to be alive! Especially since you've been invited to attend a very special Millennium New Year's Eve dinner given by that famous entrepreneur and inventor, Millford &amp;quot;Mill&amp;quot; N. Iam. Yes, Mill has invented a time travel machine and will be transporting one outstanding individual from each decade of the last century to attend this extraordinary dinner. Of course, the party will be held at Mill N. Iam's historic castle of a home, in sunny Southern California. When dinner is over, all the attendees will cast their vote for the Person of the Century. It's a party you won't want to miss, a real once-in-a-lifetime event, a night to reminisce about days gone by . . . That is, for all who live to remember . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Candidates for the PERSON OF THE CENTURY include: (By Decade)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1900-1910, Emma Rhymere is probably the foremost poet and novelist of the last century. Born and raised in Boston, she's traveled the country by train, reading her book of poetry, Moors, Mores, and S'mores, to the uneducated masses across the Western frontier. Criticizing the gluttony of the rich, Emma is level-headed and lovely, and wears the high-collared, lace-adorned clothing of her time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1910-1920, Mia Curall is easily considered the greatest scientist of the twentieth century. Having won Nobel prizes for both medicine and physics, her greatest claim to fame came when she discovered a cure for Bigpox. She's often described as being methodical and a little bit maniacal when it comes to her work, though socially, people say she has an electro-magnetic personality. She wears the latest of post-war clothing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1920-1930, Rich A. Phellar, the owner of Substandard Oil, is easily the wealthiest man of the twentieth century. Having inherited his money from his father, Rich considers himself a true blueblood. Though he's hard-nosed and hard-handed when it comes to business, in social settings he's refined and respectable, a true gentleman. Of course, he wears only tails and a top hat for evening events.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1930-1940, Scarlett Harlot is probably the most gifted and gorgeous actress this century has ever known. The original fainting femme fatale, she has starred in such box office hits as: It's a Wonderful Wife, and The Lizard of Schnoz. Scarlett believes a good actress should be demure and sweet, a thing of beauty like a fine painting or sculpture. She wears only the most glamorous and glitziest of evening gowns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1940-1950, General George S. Lapem is considered one of the greatest military minds the US Army has ever known. His amazing leadership abilities, along with his talent for combat strategy, played a huge role in the winning of World War II. Gruff, rough, and tough, the General was raised in a military family and comes from a long line of Generals. He only wears army fatiques or his uniform wherever he goes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1950-1960, Eve N. Louder is probably the greatest fashion designer of the century. But she's also the founder of Eve N. Louder Cosmetics, one of the world's top-selling companies when it comes to make-up and perfume. Rich, spoiled and eccentric, Eve considers herself to be the original fashion police, claiming her only real goal is to make the world a more beautiful place. She always wears dresses of her own design.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1960-1970, Blaze A. G'laury is an all-American hero, one of the first men in space, circling the globe during a top-secret space mission, better known as the Neanderthal project. Originally from Oklahoma, Blaze is a big, brave, brawny and brainy guy, who grew up reading science fiction. Not only does he have the right stuff, but women everywhere refer to him as &amp;quot;Mr. Right.&amp;quot; Blaze wears jumpsuits wherever he goes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1970-1980, Polly Esther Pance is probably the most influential journalist and activist this century has ever known. Founder of The Save the Sasquatch Society, an organization dedicated to the preservation of Big Foot, Polly has been involved in sit-ins and shutouts, march-downs and walkouts. She only wears the finest polyester clothes and never goes anywhere without a hefty slathering of blue eyeshadow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1980-1990, Wylie &amp;quot;Wy&amp;quot; Toukay, is considered one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the century, having essentially created the personal computer industry as well as the software industry that goes along with it. With an I.Q. that tops the genius range, Wy ushered the world into the Information Age and became a ga-zillionaire in the process. Wy dresses purely for comfort, never really caring about what he wears.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1990-1999, US President William &amp;quot;Willy&amp;quot; Groper is probably one of the more colorful presidents of the century. Described as having a dichotomous disposition, he's often charismatic and calculating, charming and crafty. With his award-winning smile, Willy is a real go-getter, a man whose cause has unfortunately, caused a few improprieties. Willy only wears clothes that bare a Presidential insignia.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is an especially fun game if you and your guests plan to dress in costumes! Because the character roles span the entire century, everyone will be wearing fashions from a different decade. Hence you'll have Emma Rhymere in her long skirts comparing herself to Polly Esther Pance, in a pantsuit or mini-skirt. How shocking! The true gentleman, Rich A. Phellar, will be appalled by Wy Toukay's casual attire, especially at dinner!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To make things even more fun, the characters from the later decades will already know the history which the characters from the earlier decades are living. Plus, the characters from the earlier part of the century will be amazed by the world of the future, the world of computers and faxes and fast cars.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All in all, this game has a number of interesting dimensions that will keep your guests entertained for hours!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Perfectly Perilous Pageant -or- Who Shot the Shoo-in?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's time once again for the annual Ms. Medusa Pageant, a beauty pageant sponsored by Medusa Hair Care, Inc. for women of all ages. This year, Ms. Sella Konn, the reigning Ms. Rocky Mountains, is just sure she's a shoo-in. In fact, she's so sure she'll win the crown that she's planned a little pre-pageant celebration, a party that many might find presumptuous, to say the least. So put on your best pageant attire, sharpen your claws and come join the party. Then watch the sparks and accusations fly, because everyone knows, the competition at a beauty pageant can really turn ugly . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Character Roles Include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rinah Plastee is a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having recently won the title of Ms. Texas Panhandle. A waitress from Odessa, Rinah is a twice-divorced mother of three. Determined, dedicated and driven, she's sure her pageant talent of skeet shooting will wow the judges and make her a winner. She always wears her Ms. Texas Panhandle crown and sash with her elegant gowns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nathanel Parks is the dashing and adorable host and announcer for the Ms. Medusa Pageant. But he is most famous for singing the Ms. Medusa song every year when the winner is crowned. Charming, chatty, and chipper, he is a precision performer and claims to have show biz in his blood. For evening events, he wears the same tuxedo he wore when the pageant first started ten years ago.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sharon Sharalyke is the reining Ms. Medusa. A native of Milwaukee, Sharon was originally crowned Ms. Urban Sprawl. She is a professional caterer and home-entertaining expert who now hosts her own cable TV show called &amp;quot;Domestic Dazzle.&amp;quot; Creative, confident, and capable, Sharon specializes in bringing back the abilities of bygone eras. She sews her own elegant evening gowns and never goes anywhere without her Ms. Medusa crown and sash.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MaeBea Shellwin is a telemarketer from Topeka. She is also a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having been crowned Ms. Great Plains just months ago. Her talent of a dramatic reading from her favorite romance novel really swept the judges away. Sweet, sappy, and sentimental, MaeBea claims to be a hopeful romantic, meaning she hopes to bag the Ms. Medusa crown in order to bag a husband. She prefers soft, dainty gowns, and always wears her Ms. Great Plains crown and sash.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dr. Tuck N. Liphte is one of the world's foremost plastic surgeons, sometimes called the King of the Collagen injections. With the right surgery and medical procedures, Tuck claims he can make any woman stunningly beautiful. Sociable, sophisticated and sardonic, he takes a personal interest in his patients' well-being and often makes house calls. He wears the utmost of evening fashions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Taykano Priznerze is another Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having won the title of Ms. Continental Divide. A taxidermist by trade, she owns her own company called &amp;quot;Stuffed with Style,&amp;quot; whereby she specializes in decorating her subjects with sequins and rhinestones. She plans to use her stuffed animals in her ventriloquist act for the pageant's talent competition. Smart, swank, and sultry, she prefers sparkling gowns to go with her Ms. Continental Divide sash and tiara.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Botan Paydphor is the head judge of the Ms. Medusa pageant. As a former halfback for the Peoria Pigeons, a semi-pro football team, he feels fully qualified to be a beauty pageant judge. Slick, suave, and self-assured, Botan enjoys hobnobbing with the bevy of beauties who enter the pageant. He usually wears a tuxedo or a perfectly tailored suit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Charmyn Lee Slick is a former Ms. Middle-Of-Nowhere and was crowned the first Ms. Medusa 10 years ago. Thanks to the scholarships awarded by the pageant, Charmyn earned her Ph.D. in Interstellar Communication and became a key radio astronomer for FETA. Tenacious, talented and temperamental, she recently became the fulltime Pageant Director for the Ms. Medusa Pageant. She wears flashy evening fashions, accessorized by her Ms. Medusa crown and sash.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Harry Medusa is the President and founder of Medusa Hair Care Incorporated, as well as the corporate sponsor and founder of the Ms. Medusa Pageant. Harry is applauded by women everywhere, both for the creation of his company's products and for considering the needs of his customers. Sincere, sensible and systematic, Harry dresses in conservative clothes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wiley Wheazle is a talent agent from Southern California. A man who flashes his thousand-watt smile as easily as he flashes his credit card, Wiley brags about being able to carry on a conversation with anyone. He constantly promotes his stable of stars, and claims to work round the clock, even while he's sleeping. Personable, persistent, and persuasive, Wiley wears only retro styles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Let's face it . . . we've all been under way too much stress lately . . . And this is the game to take that stress away . . . Yes, a Perfectly Perilous Pageant is just good, wacky fun. After a night of laughing over this incredibly unusual beauty pageant, you'll forget all about the woes of the world or your work for a while. Plus, this game provides everyone with a chance to dress up for a night. The women can all wear gowns and crowns, which can be especially fun, since, let's face it, women simply don't wear crowns enough these days . . . It's perfect for holiday entertaining, especially New Year's Eve.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Cars can be abandoned and police are able to set up road blocks. 1 die is used for travel on foot, 2 dice for cars on the streets and 3 dice for movement on motorways. The game is over when all villains are in jail at the same time (police win) or the criminals combined stolen goods is more than 1 million dollars (villains win).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;The strategy attack game with air-raising action!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has four knight pieces and one king piece.  At the beginning of the game they are placed in the row furthest from the dividing wall.  Players take turns moving one of their pieces one space (orthogonally).  They then get to use their &amp;quot;air catapult&amp;quot; to try to pop out one of their opponent's pieces.  This is done by placing their plunger in one of the vacant spaces on their side of the board and then banging it.  If their opponent has a piece in that corresponding space, it will pop up into the air.  Pieces captured in this way remain out of the game until that player moves his king up to the dividing wall, at which point he can claim a captured knight piece back (but also tips off his opponent that his king is in the front row).  The first player to move two pieces into the front row (next to the dividing wall) wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is a war game like no other.  Although the map is big (10 feet / 3.048 m) the game is smaller than other games (Europa for one). There are not as many rules as in ASL. And yet this is the biggest monster game out there for a number of reasons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is detailed to a degree no other game has come close to.  If using the full rules you keep track of every individual plane and pilot in the three year campaign. Each counter on the board representing a ground unit is composed of many units which are kept track of on logs.  Supplies are kept track of and dispersed in a very detailed manner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;From the rulebook we read how to run a game. &amp;quot;CNA is a logistically-oriented game, and its play requires not only a lot of attention to logistics, but, if you will, a logistically sound methodology.&amp;quot; It is suggested that you have 5 persons per side with the following duties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Commander-in-Chief: responsible for strategic decisions and to settle intra-team disputes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Logistics Commander: In charge of all supplies.  Accepts supply requisitions from the others and keeps all informed of supply shortages. Is in charge of supply dumps, Third line trucks and some second line trucks and is in charge of Naval convoys.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rear Area Commander: Gets the supplies to the front. In charge of security, reserves, prisoners and construction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Air Commander: In charge of all planes and pilots.  Is responsible for planning air missions and deployment of air bases.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Front-line Commander: Executes all attacks and troop movements in the front line.  Helps with coordinating defensive efforts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Playing time with 10 players is listed at 1200 hours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Xactika is an original card game that challenges players' ability to estimate the outcome of playing eight cards. You must predict the chances of being able to take the other players' cards that are laid down during each round. There is no drawing or discarding. You must predict exactly &amp;ndash; hence the name Xactika &amp;ndash; the number of rounds in which you will be able to take the cards played. Cards that appear too weak to take a trick initially may become strong enough to do so as the hand evolves. Players must recognize the value of their hand, not just from having the highest point cards in one of the four combinations on each card, but also from an understanding of the chances that for some of their other cards that no cards of the same combination may remain in the hands of the other players. Xactika, while of the same genre as Spades or Euchre, has more opportunity and takes a little more skill.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To play you must examine your hand to find cards in specific combinations that have values that are greater than your opponents. Some cards are sure bets, but only if you can take the lead. Other cards have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. You must also arrange to play your cards so that at the end of each hand you don't get stuck with a trick you don't want. The outcome of a hand is not determined until the end of the eight rounds, so each player must keep focused on the play throughout each of the eight hands of the game. Keep on your toes, and figure out how to take, as well as avoid taking, tricks. There are a number of ways to play each hand, but finding the way to make exactly the right numbers of bids is the challenge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>An interesting word game where alphabet tiles are placed in a pile in the center of the table. &amp;quot;Pieces of Eight&amp;quot; (cardboard coins) are distributed equally among all players. Five cards are dealt to each player, on the cards are a 'something' When the dealer says &amp;quot;Dig!&amp;quot; all players turn up their top card and begin digging through the letters in the pile to spell a word descriptive of their card. The winner is the person who spells a word for all five cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Scoring is simply paying the winner a &amp;quot;piece of eight&amp;quot; for each uncompleted card in your hand. Each person must also pay one &amp;quot;piece of eight&amp;quot; per letter that his longest word is shorter than the winner's longest word. If the winner misspells a word, or has not actually completed all 5 cards he must pay all other players 2 &amp;quot;pieces of eight.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Variants include setting a minimum number of letters for words or only allowing a word to be used once for any card during the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;First published in January 1940, it must have been a hit.  The second edition followed in March, 1940.  By February 1942 they were on the 30th edition!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Empire is a strategic level, traditional hex grid and counter wargame set in a hypothetical ancient era continent.  The game is best with 4 players but can be played with 3 or 2.   Players must manage the economic, diplomatic and military affairs of their faction as they vie for control of the Empire.  Piece density is low &amp;ndash; 117 units.  The game is low to moderate complexity by traditional wargame standards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The map contains 15 (fictional) provinces of varying sizes and terrain.  There is a large ocean area.  Each Province produces Tribute (in gold coins) for the player who controls it, the amount depending upon the number and size of cities in the Province.  Tribute is spent on building units, supplying units in the field, diplomatic initiatives, building fortifications, hiring mercenaries, and bribing other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Military units are Light and Heavy Cavalry, Light and Heavy Infantry, Imperial Guards Infantry, Warships and Siege Engines.  No province can produce all of these and some can only produce 1 or 2.  Units attain Veteran status after engaging in battle, which increases their effectiveness.  Mercenaries can be hired from neutral provinces but cost more to supply than regular units.  Naval battles and amphibious operations are possible (and may be necessary, as one Province is an island).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Units use an innovative combination of area movement (in friendly territory) and hex-by-hex movement (elsewhere).  Cavalry moves first and, uniquely, exerts a Zone of Control.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Province may, at any given point, be neutral or controlled by a player.  Control may be obtained by military means (by occupying all of the province&amp;rsquo;s cities) or political.  A wide variety of events trigger an &amp;ldquo;Influence Check&amp;rdquo;, which can result in a change of Political Control.  The Political Control system is really the heart of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The turn sequence consists of interlocking phases: each &amp;ldquo;year&amp;rdquo; contains an annual phase for collecting tribute and resolving control changes, 4 seasonal turns for building and supplying units and conducting diplomacy (etc.), and 12 campaign turns for military operations (campaigning in winter is more costly).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The map is printed on glossy paper; the counters are on thick cardboard but need to be cut out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overall, Empire presents some innovative game mechanics which complement its theme well.  Fans of ancient era wargames or games with a strong diplomatic element should take a look.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Very Domestic Demise -Or- Who Creamed the Cook?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ms. Barpha DeStue, that queen of culinary creativity, that heroine of homemaking and handcrafting, not to mention, star of prime time TV and best-selling cookbook author, has invited you, (Lucky, lucky you!) to attend a party at her private country estate. Of course, the focus of the festivities will be to honor the winners of the Barpha DeStue Whine &amp;amp; Dyin' Contest, soon to become an annual event.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Provided, of course, that all goes well . . . For Barpha DeStue is sure to make a meal that is TO DIE FOR . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your Dinner Companions Include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Toto Lee Smytten is the President of Barpha DeStue's fan club, the Barphalots, and has taken the club to places it's never been before. Often described as being &amp;quot;driven,&amp;quot; he prefers to use the word &amp;quot;focused.&amp;quot; For he's the kind of guy whose train only runs on one track. Meaning: He never forgets his priorities - especially his number one priority. Because he's often in the limelight with Barpha, he's always dressed so he's ready to help with any home remodeling projects, and he never goes anywhere without his tool belt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cherrie S. Ghubellee is a woman of many minds and moods, and can easily switch from being a serious businesswoman to a free-spirited artisan in the blink of an eye. She holds the title of Foods and Cooking Editor for Barpha's internationally acclaimed magazine, Existing. While always dressed as the professional, personally, she's well-liked and empathic, a natural team-player.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hiram &amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot; K. Lesteral is a world-class tennis pro, known for his backhand as well as his passionate persona on the court. Both bold and brawny, with his professional ranking he can easily afford such emotional antics, having amassed a few US Open championships and having come so close to that most notable of all crowns - Wimbledon. Yet he does have one other claim to fame: He's Barpha DeStue's ex-husband.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;N. Vee Ausse is a happy homemaker from Winnemucca, Nevada, and one of the winners of the Barpha DeStue Whine &amp;amp; Dyin' Contest. Though she spends most of her time taking care of her husband and two teenage children, Vee loves to entertain and is also quite active in her community. For in her own way, she wants to make the world a better place for her children, and her children's children. She's often asked if she'll become politically active someday. But she quickly declines, saying she's not really cut out for life in the public eye, and prefers to be more of a behind the scenes kind of person.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Marin Nate' is a transplant from France and once billed as the top chef in the country. His credits include such items as having hosted a gourmet cooking show and writing a syndicated column. And let's not forget about his long line of specialty cookbooks, with such titles as: You Say Fricassaw, I Say Fricassee - I'm Right.&amp;quot; Yes, Marin's name is synonymous with &amp;quot;Mean Cuisine&amp;quot; in this country. But after living the high-pressure, fast-paced life of a celebrity, he's decided to take things a bit easier and accepted a position on the staff of Barpha DeStue, where he can spend all his time creating culinary delights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Borissa &amp;quot;Bor&amp;quot; D. Stiphe is a homemaker from the Hoosier state, as well as the wife of an insurance salesman, Reilly Stiphe, and the mother of their three darling children. She's also a winner of the Barpha DeStue Whine &amp;amp; Dyin' Contest. It's such a thrill for her, considering she's a big Barpha fan. For Barpha's books and TV show have been an enormous help to her in her role as a homemaker. Thus Bor has constantly followed Barpha's activities, always keeping up on the latest Barpha innovations. And now Bor is so excited to finally have a chance to meet up with Barpha - up close and personal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tilly V. Isone is the wonderfully talented and innovative producer of Barpha DeStue's weekly half-hour television show, Existing with Barpha DeStue. Because Tilly knows just how to coax the perfect performance out of any public personality, she's played a huge role in Barpha's success, helping to transform her name into a household word. Charming and easygoing, Tilly often dresses in the same comfortable casualness as Barpha herself. Because everyone knows, life in the television world can be very erratic. But for Tilly, there could be no other life.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ray Zhor Sharpe is a traveling knife salesman who supplies Barpha with all her cooking and crafts cutlery. Having had Ms. DeStue on his client list for many years now, Ray has always been highly dependable in providing her with the finest cutlery in the business - something that's terribly important to one who has such a great need for knives as Barpha. Personally, Ray is a no-frills, old-fashioned kind of guy, who works hard to support his family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This mystery is a parody on one of the great home entertaining gurus of our time, whose name we shall not mention . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In comparison, this game is written for those of you with very busy lives, who still want to do a little entertaining now and then. This mystery is one of the absolute easiest games to host! Ordering pizza to be delivered is actually written into the game, and to decorate for the party, we recommend using Barpha's suggested theme: &amp;quot;Tools and Toilet Paper, Beautiful as well as Functional.&amp;quot; Yes, after taping the enclosed poster to the front door, you may proceed to decorate your dining/living area with toilet paper bows and streamers, and add a few pairs of pliers and screwdrivers to complete the effect. Then, of course, as your guests arrive, you're supposed to act as though such a decorating theme is simply divine!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yes, this is one party that you and your guests will never forget . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BOOGIE WOOGIE BUNGLE UP -or- Who Bopped the Bea B. Opp?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's December 9, 1943. Gentle snowflakes fall softly on New York City as the Christmas season goes into full swing. While World War II is raging across the ocean, world-renowned USO singer, Bea B. Opp, is preparing to leave for another tour through war-torn Europe. Tonight she has invited you to a private dinner party at that famous New York City hotel, the Alldorph Hysteria, where she often performs when she is stateside. After dinner, Miss Opp will debut her latest song, written by Big Band leader, Harry Lumbar. What a wonderful opportunity to see her perform before she and her troupe leave for the front lines, to nobly entertain our brave soldiers for Christmas on her upcoming USO tour. Yes, it's sure to be a night filled with glitz and glamor, as the stars come out to show their stuff. But you know what they say about stars: They always burn brightest before they die . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your Dinner Companions Include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Constance Leigh Wyning, who epitomizes the beauty and dazzle of a USO singer. Always effervescent, she gurgles with talent, motivating our boys abroad to &amp;quot;Fight! Fight! Fight!&amp;quot; Yet her sparkle is more than skin deep; she's a home grown girl from the Midwest, a real American sweetheart, discovered and brought to the stage by Bea B. Opp herself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tito Tellar is a man of great mystery and intrigue. Though very little is known about Tito, he's often been seen traveling across Europe, never far from the front lines. Always keeping his emotions in check, he's known to be impeccably groomed and well-dressed. Yet oddly enough, no one seems to know where he comes from, or for that matter, where he's been.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Major Hornswagle &amp;quot;Horn&amp;quot; D. Augge, is the military man in charge of Bea B. Opp's USO tour group. He's an officer who takes great pride in the way he handles his entertainers, particularly his female entertainers. Flamboyant and fun-loving, he joined the armed services when he realized a uniform is like a magnet when it comes to attracting the opposite sex.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jessica &amp;quot;Jess&amp;quot; Abell, can easily be described with one word - patriotism, with a capital P. She would do anything to help our boys fighting overseas. First there was her stint as a factory worker, a regular Rosie the Riveter, building airplanes to wipe out the Third Reich. After retiring there, she came to work as Bea B. Opp's personal secretary, traveling with the USO tour and bringing happiness to fighting men everywhere.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;W.A.C. Pilot Bunny &amp;quot;Bun&amp;quot; P. Landon, is the pilot who transports Bea B. Opp's USO troupe across the ocean and throughout Europe. It's the opportunity of a lifetime for Bun. She's wanted to fly professionally since she was a little girl, when her father, the late Colonel Girrup Landon, first took her for a spin in a biplane. Spunky, gutsy, and known to dress in either great glitz or her flying fatigues, she always personalizes her outfits with a monogram.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Oliver &amp;quot;Ol&amp;quot; W. Ashedup, is Miss Opp's agent and manager. A shrewd and charismatic businessman, without him, Bea wouldn't be where she is now. Ol is the kind of man who enjoys working hard, but likes to play just as hard. When he's not busy promoting his star, he's a happy-go-lucky, modern man of the 40s, who's not afraid to have a little fun once in a while.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Harry Lumbar is a world-renowned Big Band leader, one of the country's finest. His songs are heard in every dance hall in the free world, and hummed in the homes of his fans everywhere. The name Harry Lumbar can hardly be mentioned without being followed with such descriptions as &amp;quot;brilliant&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;genius.&amp;quot; Personally, Harry thrives on his stardom, especially since he worked so hard to get where he is. Cordially charming and never too busy for his public, his stints in the USO show have only made him even more popular than ever.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winona &amp;quot;Wi&amp;quot; Bauther, is the youngest daughter of that famous Vaudeville family act, the Royal Bauthers. Grown up to be a glamorous songstress, she was a shoe-in when Bea B. Opp was gathering together a USO troupe. Sophisticated, sleek, and always the professional entertainer, she someday hopes to be as big a star as Miss Opp herself.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a fabulous mystery for those of you who love the 1940s and big band music. Because the storyline is centered around a USO troupe, playing swing music throughout the party is a must. Also, if you're looking for a party where everyone can dress up more glamorously, this is the game for you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And since this game is set in December, if you like, you can even drag out your holiday decorations and set them up to add to the scene. This is especially fun in the middle of summer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ah, yes, was there ever a more romantic era than the 40s?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Shifty and shady, he's usually dressed to ride the range.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Burgandy &amp;quot;Bur&amp;quot; Dello, a favorite at the local watering hole, the Sure Shot Saloon, is the Belle of the Bar and star of the cancan. Having gotten her start in San Francisco, she prefers life in the wilds of Southern Colorado. She's saucy and showy, and known throughout the West for her charms that men just can't resist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Chief Lost'Um Land is an elder from the little-known Sowee tribe, formerly located high in the Southern Rockies, but now living on a desert reservation in New Mexico. Diplomatic and insightful, he's greatly respected among his own people, as well as the white men's agencies. For he often says, &amp;quot;It's never a good day to die.&amp;quot; And of course, he always dresses in his native attire and carries his hatchet everywhere.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Virginia &amp;quot;Virgin&amp;quot; Gnomoire, is the local school marm, having relocated to the Wild West from the civilized East, where she received her formal education. She's intelligent, articulate, and patient with her students. But beneath her prim and proper exterior, as well as her conservative clothing, she's a raging beauty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;S. Cooper &amp;quot;Coop&amp;quot; DeNuze, is also from the East. Both a newspaper writer and a novelist for 7&amp;cent; novels, he's come to the West to capture the colorful characters that have aroused the curiosity of Easterners. Outgoing and inquisitive, Coop prides himself on getting the story that sells the copy. He always dresses professionally,and since he's been out West, he sometimes wears a combination of Eastern and Western attire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Manfred &amp;quot;Man&amp;quot; Euell Laybore, is a hard-working, honest man whose backbreaking efforts helped build the railroad that Eli now runs. Strong and ruggedly handsome, Man is known to be up front and direct in his dealings. Yet he's widely popular with the other railroad workers and known to be a leader when it comes to labor issues. His attire usually fits the occasion: whether that means working on the tracks or attending a Sunday social.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aimee &amp;quot;Aim&amp;quot; Ann Chute, is considered the best aim in the West, and is the star of Beaver Bob's Mild West Show. Independent and headstrong, she first learned to shoot to put food on the table. Now as she travels the countryside with the Show, she lets no man run her life. She's considered a woman years ahead of her time and often wears pants or pantskirts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;See the West as it never was . . . Or at least, we hope it was never like this . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Not only does this game have some amusing and not-too-terribly-bright characters, but this game is especially fun when it comes to costume potential! When your guests arrive at your party wearing 1880s attire, you'll see a complete transformation of their personalities. This is your chance to travel back to a colorful time in history, when the West was still wild and untamed. The setting is Durango, Colorado, where an 1880s train still takes sightseers through the splendor of the Southern Rockies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;HARD DRIVE HOMICIDE -or- Who Offed the Icon?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Welcome to Sillycon Valley, California, and to the Boardroom of Snaphu Software, Inc., where you've been summoned by the CEO himself, Major Hugh G. Snaphu, to attend an urgent late-night business meeting. The reason for the meeting remains a mystery, though the Major did mention in his email that &amp;quot;the sparks would be flying.&amp;quot; Could Snaphu Software have slipped from the #1 spot in the hard-core software wars? And why did the Major invite his main competitor, Bill D. Phences, CEO of MacroHard, Inc.? And what is the secret behind Snaphu Software's meteoric rise to the top anyway, especially since, prior to owning his company, Major Snaphu had been an Airforce jet jockey, and knew nothing about software? In any case, this is one meeting that's sure to be murder . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ALSO ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MEETING WILL BE:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Florence &amp;quot;Flo&amp;quot; P. Disque, the lovely and luscious Personal Administrative Assistant to Major Hugh G. Snaphu, CEO of Snaphu Software. Highly efficient and energetic, Flo is a master at anticipating the needs of her boss, aware of what he wants even before he asks. She's gung ho and outgoing, and known to be gutsy when going after a goal. And despite working in a corporate setting, as a former cosmetics salesperson, Flo prefers the most feminine of fashions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bill D. Phences, now in second place in the software wars, thanks to Major Hugh G. Snaphu's meteoric rise to the top. Yet Bill is still called the King of the Computer Software Industry, since his company, MacroHard, held the #1 position for years. With an IQ of 392, Bill is not only resourceful and rich, but known to be ruthless when it comes to the competition. He always wears a business suit and glasses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Harvey &amp;quot;Har&amp;quot; D. Riive, a computer software engineer who graduated from MIT before he'd even acquired all his permanent teeth. A true child prodigy, he is now Snaphu Software's top technical talent, helping the company rein high above the rest. Brilliant and baby-faced, Har is far too busy to find time for fun, let alone notice the change in fashions. Thus his wardrobe tends to be slightly outdated. As an asthmatic, he carries his inhaler wherever he goes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;C.D. Rhomme, the wise and wondrous Head of Accounting for Snaphu Software, who is highly qualified when it comes to calculating. Born and raised in Arizona, C. D. has always had an aptitude for arithmetic. Often described as being amicable and equitable, C. D. appreciates people as well as corporate profits. When it comes to clothing, C.D. is thankful for the latest trend in &amp;quot;Business Casual&amp;quot; attire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Margaret &amp;quot;Mar&amp;quot; Keating, the marvelous Director of Marketing at Snaphu Software. Pretty as well as professional, Mar is known for her niceness, and sometimes considered too naive for the hard core world of computer software. But Mar often defends herself by saying, &amp;quot;I'm only kind until someone crosses my path. Then that's the last stupid thing they do.&amp;quot; Mar wears nothing but business suits and professional attire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sergei &amp;quot;Ser&amp;quot; F. Dinette, the Director of the Shipping Department at Snaphu Software. As a former United States Postal worker, Ser thrives on efficiency. But in his job and with his work load, efficiency counts. For as far as he's concerned, the Shipping Department is the pulse of the company. Direct and determined, Ser is a big believer in honest and up-front communication. He prefers to wear military-type clothing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A. Leanne Baybee, the gorgeous gal pal of Major Hugh G. Snaphu. Yet despite her striking good looks, Leanne truly subscribes to the maxim that beauty is only skin deep. Unique, extravagant and known to be an independent thinker, she might be considered unusual by the average citizen. But she hardly cares about criticism from the mediocre masses, as she lives by her own set of standards. Of course, she has an exceptional sense of fashion, one that always flatters her features.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;S. P. Anaugge, a computer software engineer new to Snaphu Software. Dedicated and detail-oriented, S.P. is determined to make a good impression, and not afraid to work long, long hours, sometimes staying at the office late at night when no one else is around. For S.P. knows that perseverance and persistence can bring great rewards, not to mention an early retirement. Wanting to fit in with the company dress code, S.P. wears appropriate professional attire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is the ultimate in easy entertaining! In fact, it's the kind of game where you can call a bunch of friends the day before and put the party on the next night. It's written for food delivery and the costumes only require your guests to go to their closets. Plus, two of the characters, C.D. Rhomme and S.P. Anaugge, can be played as either male or female characters, so you don't have to worry about getting an even number of men and women. Like I said, it's the absolute easiest mystery game to host!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And because the setting is a late-night business meeting, I suggest serving the food on paper plates and using plastic utensils. The drinks can be served in mismatched coffee cups, since people in a work environment would each have their own coffee mug. To make things even more fun, I'd also recommend hanging a few pie charts around, showing the comparison between Snaphu Software and MacroHard Software.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Besides all that, these are some of the funniest characters we've ever created. Flo P. Disque is cosmetically challenged, and A. Leanne Baybee is absolutely . . . well . . . you'll just have to play the game and find out!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;LYNCHED IN LUCRE VALLEY -or- Who Rigged the Rig?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's July, 1952, and the oil industry has been booming in Alberta, Canada since the end of WWII. New oil reserves have been discovered just as fast as wildcatters can set up rigs and drill. As a result, new oil and oilfield service companies have been springing up like Alberta winter wheat. One such company is Drye Holle Drilling, founded by Mr. Dryesdale &amp;quot;Drye&amp;quot; Holle of Lucre Valley. And tonight, you've been invited to attend the company's First Annual Safety Award Dinner, in honor of Drye Holle Drilling's remarkable safety record. And of course, the affair will be catered by the local Crude Cafe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now the real question remains: Will Drye Holle Drilling have an outstanding safety record for a second year in a row? In any case, one thing is certain, murder would definitely mar that record . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your Dinner Companions Include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tarra &amp;quot;Tar&amp;quot; Sanze is a sassy secretary who mans the front lines of Drye Holle Drilling. Known for her smarts as well as her savvy, she's a tornado on the typewriter and a dervish when it comes to dictation. Pretty as well as proficient, she's had more than her share of suitors, but the oil industry remains the love of her life. She dresses to fit the occasion - pants or skirts for trips to the field and dazzling dresses for dinner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Derek Hand is the dashing Drilling Manager at Drye Holle Drilling, a company Derek has worked for since he and Drye returned from the War in Europe. Hard working and an industry expert, Derek's loyalty to the company is legendary. Because he's constantly on call, he prefers to wear casual work clothes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Madame Mae Kittup is an exotic beauty from the Ukraine, a gypsy woman whose psychic powers include telling the future via her magic pysankas, or Ukrainian Easter eggs. Sultry and mysterious, Madame Mae is employed by Drye Holle Drilling to locate oil reserves far beneath the Earth's surface. Yet she attributes her great gift to her grandmother, and prefers to dress in the clothing of her native land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Denver Driller is a rich and rugged oilman from the States, whose business frequently brings him to Canada, where he plans to reap the rewards of the country's bountiful resources. A world traveler, he's charming and charismatic, and a favorite among the locals. He dresses to suit the occasion, with a wardrobe that ranges from designer suits to dungarees.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Olivia &amp;quot;Ol&amp;quot; Barrinesse could be described in three simple words: rich, refined and ravishing. Originally from Calgary, she's the daughter of the late Brigham Barrinesse, from whom she inherited her wealth, as well as her independent and highly profitable oil company, Brigham Oil. Ol is always dressed in the height of fashion, famous for her foreign shopping sprees and her bounty of baubles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Andre P. Renure is a bold businessman who provides a valuable service to the oilfield consumer by running Lucre Valley's only general store and restaurant, the Crude Cafe. A Frenchman from Quebec, he came to the West after the War, hoping to amass a fortune from his vocational ventures. Shrewd and sophisticated, his suits are the latest of fifties fashions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beulah &amp;quot;Beu&amp;quot; T. Kween is a beaming beauty from the heart of bovine country, who was raised on a cattle ranch in southern Alberta. Having won more than her share of beauty contests, everyone says her future is bright, that she'll be married with a house full of kids before she can say &amp;quot;baby boom.&amp;quot; Flirtatious and fun-loving, she currently works as a waitress at the Crude Cafe, where she earns enough money to keep her wardrobe stocked with delectable dresses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Royal T. Ohhner is an Alberta cattle rancher whose range reaches far across some big beefy underground oil reserves - oil reserves that are leased to and drilled by Drye Holle Drilling. Thus Royal often jokes about raising both crude and cattle, which have proven to be real cash cows for him. A real grass roots kind of guy, he's never been one to steer away from hard work. He wears nothing but Western attire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This mystery game features a Western Canadian setting. (If you've never seen Calgary and the Canadian Rockies, then you've never really lived!) So, of course, we used some classic characters that you might find in that neck of the bush -- the Frenchman from Quebec, the Ukranian woman and her psyankas (decorated eggs), a cattle rancher and the people in the oil industry. Of course, there's also a mention of playing hockey.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Besides all that, it's set in the early 1950s, which provides so much opportunity for costumes, as well as setting the mood. People can dress either 1940s or 1950s style, and you can easily play music from both decades.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All and all, it's a fun romp, with the same lunacy and ludicrousness as the rest of our mystery games. Watch out for the surprise twist at the end!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;MURDER IN MONTANA -or- A Railroad Runs to It&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Newly-Made Millionaire And Businessman, Rumford &amp;quot;Rum&amp;quot; Runnare, Invites You: To board the Nuthin' Specific Railroad traveling west from Chicago and the Midwest. Your final destination? The newest playground for the rich and the ritzy, Montana's recently opened Roaring Rapids Resort! Not only will you enjoy the activities of the Resort, but you'll also be driven by motor coach to the grandest marvel of all, a sightseeing tour through the rugged beauty of Yellowstone National Park. It's all the rage! Your ticket to fun and frolic awaits you: dated June 18, 1925, when flappers were risque' and prohibition was the rule. The festivities will culminate on Saturday night with a private dinner party hosted by Rum himself. (And because you'll be dining in Rum's suite, you might find the laws of prohibition to be a little . . . shall we say . . . less restrictive?) It should be a night to remember. That is, provided everyone makes it through the night . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your Dinner Companions Include:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Princess Anastasia &amp;quot;Ann&amp;quot; L. Retentov claims to be the only surviving descendant of that great Russian Retentov line. And because of a little-known twist of history, she is the last remaining heir to the Russian throne, daughter of Czar Frugalin Retentov I and Czarina Wautor Retentov. Having fled the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution, Ann came to America for sanctuary. As a princess, she carries herself regally, being a classic Russian beauty and dressing in the finest of fashions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dewey Kare, is a baseball legend who has redefined the game, being both a pitching phenom and a home run hitter. But being worshiped as a hero got tiresome for Dewey. So he recently retired, and has traveled to the wilds of Montana in search of a new adventure. Yet he never forgets his years in the big leagues, and always wears a baseball jersey.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cassandra &amp;quot;Cass&amp;quot; Piajammas is a lovely &amp;amp; luscious starlet, having recently starred in her latest film, The Monotony of Marlene. And soon she is to grace the silver screen as Valentino's leading lady. Which is no surprise, considering acting is a talent that comes quite naturally to Cass. After all, her mother always did say Cass was a little melodramatic. But she's also a thoroughly modern woman of the twenties, a real flapper. And like most flappers, she's opinionated, daring and slightly out-of-control.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Barry &amp;quot;Bare&amp;quot; Marquette is a Wall Street whiz known for his gutsy gambles and daring dealings. He loves the excitement of the market, with all the ups and downs, and the dangers as well as the chance to get rich quick. Born and raised in Chicago, he tried a number of jobs at home before finally going to New York to be near the market. And because he's much sought after by women, he dresses in the height of style, sparing no expense to look dashing and dapper.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Isadore &amp;quot;Izzy&amp;quot; A. G. Mann has often been described as a chameleon-like character, easily able to change and adapt to any situation, at any time. Thus he always dresses to fit the occasion. And because he's come to Montana on vacation and wants to relax, he doesn't care to talk about his work much - though he will admit to being employed by the government. Focused and determined, he's a hard worker, and never quits until he gets the job done right.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stephanie &amp;quot;Steph&amp;quot; D. Rink is a prim and pretty prohibitionist, probably one of the most popular in the country. For her name is synonymous with sober. Often called Sister Steph, she's the founder of the Church of the Triple R - the Real Right Reformed. As a staunch activist and a prolific preacher, she's known to be quite vocal. And because she's always in the public eye, she's particular about her appearance, and often quick to follow the latest fashion fads.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Senator Vito D. Beale is a United States Senator from Illinois. A man of great power and passion, politics is in his blood, as he comes from a well-established and wealthy political family. Vito chooses his issues carefully and then fights for them to the finish. Yet he's also quite charming and cordial to the voters, and because he's got an important public image to uphold, he always dresses to the nines.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mary Widdoe, is a strikingly beautiful and well-to-do young widow who just recently lost her husband. Now, wherever she goes, she carries the urn that holds the ashes of her late husband Ernie, for as she says: &amp;quot;He made me everything I am.&amp;quot; Her friends describe her as being wonderfully charming and a great listener. And as a grieving widow, Mary often wears black, though usually in the form of designer dresses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This mystery game is especially fun for history buffs. Not only is the main storyline centered around Prohibition, but many of the characters are based (loosely) on actual historic figures. Izzy A. G. Mann, is a spoof on Izzy Einstein, one of the most famous Prohibition Agents of all. Of course, Princess Ann L. Retentov, is based somewhat on Annastasia Romanov.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game also has some special features that others don't have. For instance, a few of the clues are to be hidden around the room, and this game includes an &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; that marks the spot, though I won't tell you where.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Costumes from the twenties are especially fun, as that was the era of flappers and men in wide-lapeled pinstriped suits. Also popular at the time was a train ride from Chicago to Montana, to enjoy the splendor of Yellowstone.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you like history, you'll love this mystery!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner. Designed for a women-only setting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PUSHING UP THE DAISIES -or- Who Grounded the Gardener?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It's September 15, 1942. The Andrews Sisters and Glenn Miller are be-bopping over the wireless, and women's hemlines are just a little bit higher than they were a few years ago. Sugar and gasoline and nearly everything else is being rationed while World War II is raging in Europe and the Pacific.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Meanwhile, you're at home in Phunguss Flats, Florida, a town that supports the War effort and our soldiers fighting overseas. Of course, the war hasn't hindered the activities of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club. As a member, you're about to attend the monthly luncheon meeting scheduled for today. As always, it's being held in the clubhouse, just up the walk and past the Sycamore trees from the club's greenhouse. This month's special speaker will be Dr. H. Orty Kulchure, local professor of Botany, who also served as the judge for last month's rose competition. Dr. Kulchure will be speaking on the subject of &amp;quot;Practical Pruning, or Using Those Dead Limbs for Fertilizer.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With the motto, &amp;quot;Our Petals are Perpetually Open,&amp;quot; you might say the Phunguss Flats Garden Club has a long and lascivious history, one that's fueled a lot of talk around the town.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For all who live to talk about it, that is . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Members of the Phunguss Flats, Florida Garden Club Are:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mumsy Worde is the President of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club. With her husband currently serving in the Armed Forces overseas, Mumsy has found other activities to keep her occupied and to support the War effort. Known to be as cultured as she is charismatic, she dresses in the latest of Paris fashions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Barbara &amp;quot;Barb&amp;quot; Wyre is the Secretary of the Garden Club, and holds office in nearly every guild, league and sorority in town. Both pretty and openly opinionated, she is married to the Mayor, the wealthiest man in Phunguss Flats. Yet despite her privilege, Barb prides herself on having perfected the art of self-sacrifice. She prefers to wear dresses with large flowered-prints and hats to match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Schyla &amp;quot;Schye&amp;quot; Sphinstere is the Garden Club's Treasurer, as well as the town's librarian. Sweet, shy and somewhat secretive, she's an avid reader of romance novels and is still waiting for a prince on a Palomino to whisk her away. And while she's waiting for our military men to return stateside, Schye is active in the War effort, keeping the home fires hot. She wears mostly skirts and sweaters.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Auntie Pausto is as famous for her pasta as she is for her petunias. A first generation Italian-American, Auntie Pausto is proud of her heritage. And though she works part-time as a cook at the Phunguss Cafe, her family remains her number one priority. Lovely and lively, she prefers lace to linen, and owns an apron for every occasion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Daisy Flinger is the illustrious and affluent heiress to the great Flinger Darning Machine fortune. Never married, she lives in her mansion with a multitude of cats and claims: &amp;quot;You can never be too rich or have too many tabbies.&amp;quot; While she wears the latest of 40s fashions, she believes she is never fully dressed until she is adorned with diamonds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sharla &amp;quot;Shar&amp;quot; P. Knedelz is an Army nurse who is home from the frontlines, having recently returned from the trenches of war-torn Europe. Caring, compassionate, and comely, Barb joined the Garden Club thanks to her interest in the medicinal uses of plants. Proud of her profession, she wears her nurse's uniform wherever she goes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ima Gardner is a gorgeous and glamorous movie star who calls Phunguss Flats her home whenever she's not working on her latest film. Hailed by Hollywood Today magazine as &amp;quot;the brightest star bound to burn out before her time,&amp;quot; she is one of the most sought-after celebrities in America. Because of her fame, she absolutely, positively, in-no-way and under-no-conditions goes anywhere without wearing her makeup, as well as the most up-to-date, eye-catching attire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sister Celeste &amp;quot;Cel&amp;quot; I. Bett is new to the local nunnery, run by the Sisters of Incessant Anguish. Having recently relocated from New York, Sister Cel is thoughtful and intelligent, and enjoys a wide range of interests, from science to foreign languages. Though she's an outspoken activist for peace, she rallies behind the efforts of the Allied Forces. Of course, she wears nothing but her nun's habit.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All right, ladies . . . do you have a bridal shower or a baby shower coming up sometime soon? Or maybe a favorite friend is about to have a birthday, or maybe you're just looking for an excuse to get together with your female friends? Then here's your chance to add tons of hilarity to your gathering.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the irony of the game is that all the characters initially appear so prim and proper, in their hats and gloves, as they attend the Garden Club meeting. It isn't long before you learn that these ladies are anything but prim and proper! Kind of like real life, wouldn't you say?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Costuming is very easy -- hats and gloves and dresses or suits. In other words, everyone can pretty much just go to their closets. If you like, you can play this game as a part of a luncheon, or play it in the evening with drinks and snacks. In any case, just relax and laugh with your friends!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner. Designed for a women-only setting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BUMP-OFF AT THE BEAUTY SHOP -or- Who Waxed the Highbrow?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Loopey Lady Beauty Shop, located in beautiful Looslypes, Louisiana, invites you to attend the shop's tenth anniversary celebration, a special day indeed, since some said this celebration would never happen. Especially after the beauty shop relocated this year to that old Victorian house in downtown Looslypes, Louisiana, a home once owned by Miss Meara Unkinde, a woman whose deathbed promise was to haunt the beauty shop and wreak havoc on the hair of all who enter there. Plus there has also been mention of some missing jewels, a decades old mystery somehow connected to one of the Loopey Lady's best customers, Kat E. Cauldhart. None-the-less, life goes on at the Loopey Lady. . as does the trimming, teasing, detangling, highlighting, low lighting, perming, and oh, yes . . . let's not forget about the dyeing . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Attending the Celebration will be:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Faulleen Sizzorze is the lovely and lively owner of the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. A savvy businesswoman who has survived the ups and downs of the Looslypes, Louisiana economy, she's managed to bring her business, as well as her customers' hair, to new heights. Hardworking and headstrong, Faulleen is the queen of customer service, making sure her clients adore their do's. Hairdo's, that is. She dresses in the trendiest of fashions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gilda D. Nailson is the Loopey Lady's manicurist. But she's also an amateur psychic, as well as an aspiring actress who has appeared in the local community theatre's production of Edgar Allen: a Poe-trait of Fright. Giddy, gregarious and grandiose, Gilda is the ultimate glamour girl and simply adores glitz. She wears anything with glitter, sequins or rhinestones.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Coco Coiffure is a new girl in town, having moved into the decrepit old DeDaye home, which holds as much dust as it does ill-fated history. Mysterious, moody and often melodramatic, Coco is quick to change the subject when the questions are directed at her. And of course, she's a constant customer at the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. She prefers the clothing of eras gone by.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Barri Bouffant is a beautiful and boisterous benefactor, a woman whose heart is as big as the hairdo atop her head. She is the founder of the Let the Large Lizards Live Society, for which she hosts a charity ball at her own mansion every year. Bubbly and bodacious, Barri is partial to anything big, including big jewelry, big dresses, big handbags, and of course, big bucks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Teasanne Kombe is a hair stylist at the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. Sassy, stunning and sophisticated, Teasanne has studied the art of haute coiffure in such high fashion centers as Paris and Milan. She recently returned to the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop, the salon where she first learned to trim, tease and detangle. Teasanne wears nothing but the latest in dark-colored clothing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ruby Redhedd is a ravishing redhead as well as a reporter for the local Looslypes Herald. Flashy, famous and fearless, she's got the guts to go for the important exposes. Some say she has the total package: brains, ambition, and beauty, and that one day she'll be an anchor on a major network news station. Ruby is a regular at the Loopey Lady and wears only business suits&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Flo Z. Frizzee is the shop's stylist who specializes in the art of perming. Big or small, she'll curl them all. Ingenious, elegant and slightly introverted, Flo is a whiz when it comes to chemical applications, and she's never afraid to try out the latest technology, all in the name of hair science. Often caught with her nose in a chemistry book, Flo dresses for comfort and not for fashion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Harriet Hilite is the wife of the wealthiest doctor in town, and an active member of the local Gamma Gabba Gabba women's sorority. Refined, regal and ravishing, Harriet has an absolute gift for gossip and is considered a well-connected link in Looslype's grapevine. She is a weekly customer at the Loopey Lady, and whether she dresses up or dresses down, she only wears designer duds and her finest jewelry.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All right, ladies . . . need an excuse to get together with your gal-pals and have a good giggle-fest? Then here's the perfect mystery party game for you! It doesn't get any goofier than this one!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;And here's the beauty part of this game. (And I do mean &amp;quot;beauty!&amp;quot;) This game is written to be part of an at-home spa/pampering party. That's right. For a really memorable event, we recommend mud masks, manicures, and more. Suggestions on how to host an easy pampering party are included in the game instructions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Again, we bring you the ultimate in easy entertaining. Costuming is ultra easy -- this is a virtual come-as-you-are party. Though the truly adventurous might consider arriving in cold cream and curlers . . . We also suggest serving appetizers instead of a meal with this one, so you'll have plenty of time for the pampering part of the party. This is a great game for bridal showers, birthdays, and just having fun with your female friends!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner. Designed for a women-only setting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;High Tea at the Liberty Library -or- Who Toasted the Tart?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ladies . . . It's May, 1955 and time once again for the monthly meeting of the Liberty Library League. This meeting promises to be one you won't want to miss, with plenty of topics to talk about. First of all, Nona Tumuch, the famous author who recently released that scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed, has finally decided to step off that high-and-mighty horse she's been riding and join the Liberty Library League. Though one must wonder, what made her finally accept an invitation and be part of a group she has spurned for so long?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of course, there will also be the final dollar count from last week's Library League Bake Sale. Hopefully, with the sales of the goodies from Cooky Kuttre and Meena Ann Moody, the Library League might finally be able to afford that statue of the famous Outlaw Jose Whines, who once called Liberty his home. Oh, and speaking of Meena Ann Moody, she's let everyone know that she'll be making a big announcement at the meeting, one she claims will impact everyone's lives. Hopefully she won't be pulling any dusty skeletons from any musty closets, as no doubt, everyone's got a few secrets they'd rather remained that way . . . SECRET! In any case, as usual, the Liberty Library Leagues meets during High Tea at the Liberty Library . . . Though this may be one High Tea that sinks to a much lower level . . .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also Attending the Liberty Library League Meeting Will Be:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Priscilla &amp;quot;Priss&amp;quot; E. Dings is the President of the Liberty Library League, having been elected to the position for seven years in a row. The wife of prominent attorney, Wynn G. Dings, Priss is prim, pretty, and practical - the epitome of the high-society sophisticate. As an excellent example of what an upstanding citizen should be, Priss is active in many charitable causes and is always happy to help those beneath her. Priss dresses in the latest of fifties fashions, and never goes anywhere without a hat and matching gloves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Nona Tumuch is one of the nation's top novelists. Her name has practically become a household word ever since she released her scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed. Some say the book reflects the seamier side of Liberty, a side that many of the town's prominent citizens would rather keep under wraps. As an author, Nona is intelligent, outspoken, and always investigating the latest story. She wears suits of subtle colors, with a hat and gloves to match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hope Leslie Devoted is the Fan Club President for that most sensational of all singers, America's #1 heartthrob himself, Bobby Daring. What an honor for any woman! Hope takes her presidential duties seriously, and is instantly offended if someone speaks badly about Bobby. Dreamy, dramatic and determined, Hope spends a lot of time at the library, reading all the latest &amp;quot;Bobby Babble&amp;quot; in the magazines. She wears skirts and sweaters, and usually ties a scarf around her neck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Garnett Jeuell was once elected Debutante of the Year at Liberty's annual Country Club Cotillion, an honor that landed her more marriage proposals than she could count. Now engaged to a handsome local businessman, Har D. Wirkenslob, Garnett spends most of her time planning the perfect wedding and shopping for the most fabulous home furnishings she can find. Sassy, showy, and sharp-witted, Garnett prefers flashy frocks and jeweled accessories.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cooky Kuttre is an acutely happy homemaker, a woman who finds total fulfillment from merely meeting the needs of her man, her husband, Mete Kuttre. Like all really good housewives, Cooky is the queen of the kitchen, and just loves to spend her time concocting the latest culinary creation. She also brags about having a house where &amp;quot;dirt dare not tread, for fear it will instantly be sucked into the vacuum bag.&amp;quot; Active, opinionated, and organized, Cooky wears simple dresses and never goes anywhere without her apron.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Madame Fabra Cates is a clairvoyant who recently relocated to Liberty, after her spirit guides strongly suggested she move here. Fabra not only tells the future by reading tea leaves, but she also claims to communicate with those who have passed from this life to the next. Temperamental, thoughtful, and theatrical, Fabra prefers to wear wildly colored clothing, with lots of jewelry and a bright headscarf.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gussie D. Uppe has recently returned home to Liberty, after mysteriously being away for six months. A trust-fund tot, her father owns the biggest bank in Liberty, and Gussie grew up with an abundance of riches. She is often considered the best bridge player in town, though she is also quite adept at Canasta and Charades, and many other party games. Tight-lipped, tenacious, and trustworthy, Gussie wears the latest of designer clothes, hats and gloves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Luv Swept is a writer of romance novels and has recently moved to Liberty to research the tragic life and death of her long, lost twin brother, Adonis Studd. Luv hopes to write his story into one of her novels, much like her own numerous ill-fated love affairs have been the inspiration for her books thus far. Sweet, sensitive, and soft-spoken, Luv likes pastel or flowered dresses, with a hat and gloves to match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>NFL Strategy is a football game based on plays and the ability to execute them rather than on team statistics. The number of offensive plays and defensive plays varies with each edition and one special teams card are included. Each player secretly chooses his play. The defensive play (which has clear &amp;quot;windows&amp;quot; on it)is played on top of the offensive play to reveal five possible outcomes of the play. To find the result you roll two six sided dice and add them together. The dice roll determines which &amp;quot;window&amp;quot; the players look at and this is the result of the play. The result also takes into account whether the ball is on the left hash mark, the right hash mark or in the center of the field. Earlier versions of this game used a spring loaded bead that you flipped to determine which &amp;quot;window&amp;quot; to look at.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The game covers the first 48 hours of the offensive launched by General Edmund Allenby's army on the 19th September 1918 in northern Palestine (now Israel).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The battle commenced just before dawn on the 19th after a brilliant deception operation that ensured that the Turks were out of place. It pitted a British army consisting mostly of Indian and Australian troops against the Ottoman Turks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The speed at which the British army's mounted units moved and the distances they covered during the 48 hours and immediately afterwards, exceeded the best efforts of the Germans in any of their WW2 &amp;quot;Blitzkriegs.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;COMPONENTS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     11x17 inch map representing northern Palestine.&amp;#10;     154 double sided counters on a sticker sheet shows the forces controlled by each player and markers.&amp;#10;     One rulebook&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Ever been accused of being judgmental (as if that's a bad thing)? Well, here's your chance to shine. In this game of true court cases, players are in the position to judge for themselves. Five hundred cards outline the cases--and with names like &amp;quot;Trespassing Hounds,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Shocking News,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Forced Nuptials,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Quality Chicken,&amp;quot; players are sure to be intrigued. The game can be played by two players or two teams. To start, a team rolls the die. A 1, 2, or 3 lets them know how many scorecard spaces they can fill in if they arrive at the correct verdict. After reading a case, they deliberate, debate, and finally decide for or against the plaintiff. A correct verdict advances the team. An incorrect verdict leaves them cooling their heels. The first team to arrive at the finish line wins. Sometimes being judgmental feels good. --Wendy Slotboom&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Blitzkrieg Stalled: The Battle for Arras: May 21-22, 1940, is an introductory level game of the battle between the Allied Armed forces and Germany's Wehrmacht on May 21st and 22nd, 1940. The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The main German offensive, dubbed the Sichelschnitt (razor cut), struck through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest. The Germans quickly broke through the Allied main line of defense along the Meuse River at Sedan and Dinant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;German Tank and mechanized forces, led by General Erwin Rommel's 7th Panzer Division, were boldly sent racing towards the English Channel to cut the Allied forces in half. The Allies launched a desperate counter-attack against the now strung-out and vulnerable German spearhead near the town of Arras. The fate of the Western forces hung in the balance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the fourth game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series from High Flying Dice Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Game Turn: 1.5 hours&amp;#10;Hex: 1 miles / 1.61 kilometer&amp;#10;Units: Battalion to Regiments (British heavy tank units are company size)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;One 11x17&amp;quot; full color map&amp;#10;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (224 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&amp;#10;One 7-page rulebook&amp;#10;Two Player aid Charts (TEC/CRT)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&amp;#10;Complexity Level: Low&amp;#10;Players: 2 or more&amp;#10;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The Germans launched Operation Yellow, the invasion of France and the Low Countries, on May 10, 1940. The German vanguard of General Hoepner's XVI Coprs ran head-on into the defending French First Army led by General Rene Prioux at the &amp;quot;Gembloux Gap&amp;quot;. The Germans hoped to seize the crucial open ground between the Dyle and Meuse Rivers, unhinging the Allied line. The Germans also hoped to tie-up Allied forces here, so that they could not be used to oppose the main German offensive effort coming through the Adrennes further south. The resulting conflict in May was the largest tank battle fought to the point in the war.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is the second game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series from High Flying Dice Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Scale:&amp;#10;Game Turn: 1.5 hours&amp;#10;Hex: 0.75 miles / 1.61 kilometer&amp;#10;Units: Battalion to Regiments&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game Inventory:&amp;#10;One 11x17&amp;quot; full color map&amp;#10;One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (224 1/2&amp;quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)&amp;#10;One 6-page rulebook&amp;#10;One Player Aid Chart (TEC/CRT)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&amp;#10;Complexity Level: Low&amp;#10;Players: 2 or more&amp;#10;Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A race game between eight fantasy monsters selected at random from a deck of 25 (e.g., medusa, cyclops, vampire, zombie, centaur, dragon, griffin, djinni).  Players get secret agendas, listing the order they want the monsters to finish according to colored mover bases for the cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each player's turn, they move a monster toward the finish line. All monsters move forward a die roll but if you are moving a monster that doesn't score high for you, you can waste its movement by zig-zagging or wandering into non-native terrain.  Each monster must move once per round, so even those that no one likes will get moved (and present bluffing opportunities for clever players).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A monster can attack once per move -- a great way to slow down a monster you don't like is to beat it unconscious.  Each monster is rated for the number of custom attack dice (marked with just 0s and 1s) they throw to find damage.  Monsters also have special powers, some active all the time and others that only kick in when a custom &amp;quot;wacky die&amp;quot; shows sword or shield icons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes reversible mapboards with different terrain patterns (brush, rock, water, etc.) to create a wide variety of maps.  Monsters move into their native terrains as if they were blank squares and get a defensive bonus as well.  Some monsters can fly, ignoring terrain except where they land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The race ends when three monsters have crossed the finish line.  Everybody counts up the points listed on their secret agendas for those three monsters.  Example: the dragon, doppleganger, and hare finish in that order. My agenda says dragon 8, doppleganger 5, and hare 3 so I score 16 points; the monsters I had listed for positions 7, 6, 4, 2 and 1 didn't finish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note that this description is for the 2014 edition of the game.  The original used regular dice, counters rather than cards, scored all eight finishers and had players set their own agendas (both of which stretched out the game considerably).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>(from the back of the box:)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Beginning in September 1775 and running through the end of 1781, Give Me Liberty! covers the military campaigns that helped create the United States of America. All of the important generals are here: George Washington, Benedict Arnold, Lafayette,&amp;quot;Mad Anthony&amp;quot; Wayne, &amp;quot;Gentleman John&amp;quot; Burgoyne, Francis (&amp;quot;Swamp Fox&amp;quot;) Marion, Howe, Cornwallis, etc. Special rules flesh out the men, and their unique abilities and liabilities. The game system is fast paced, and creates a challenging situation for both sides.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;IN ADDITION TO THE FULL CAMPAIGN GAME, there are four shorter campaign scenarios. The Invasion of Canada follows the fortunes of Arnold and Montgomery, as they attempt to add a 14th Colony to those in rebellion. Saratoga 1777 covers the British attempt to conquer the Hudson Valley. Summer 1780 features the British attempt to separate the colonies of the Deep South from their rebellious brethren to the North, and finally Greene's Carolina Campaign follows the attempt by Nathaniel Greene to rectify the previous year's failure by Horatio Gates.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;THE RULES cover Militia, promotions, supply, leader exchanges', entrenchements, initiative, attrition, politics, Indians, and even Lord Germain. The naval rules cover amphibious assaults, interception at sea, ocean transport, and blockade. Counters represent regiments, naval squadrons, leaders, artillery, Indians, the French, etc. &amp;#10;Each turn represents 2 weeks, or a month (in winter), with strategic interphases between turns. Victory is determined by the relative standing of the two sides on a Political Track, which is in turn, determined by a variety of events and by control of the vatious colonies. &amp;#10;The British player generally moves first in each game turn, but the American, player may, by the accumulation of Victory Points, acquire and use (at the moment of his choosing) Initiative Chits, which enable him to reverse the order of movement-s-thus seizing the initiative.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Designed by award-winning designer Rob Markham, Give Me Liberty! is both an accurate and detailed simulation, and also a fast paced and intense game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;CONTENTS: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;    One rulebook &amp;#10;    Two 34&amp;quot; x 22&amp;quot; maps&amp;#10;    400 die&amp;middot;cut counters&amp;#10;    One 10&amp;middot;sided&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PLAYERS: 2&amp;middot;4,also makes an excellent solitaire game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PLAYING TIME: 2-6 hours, depending upon scenario chosen.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>(from back of box)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Luke Skywalker,  Princess Leia, Han Solo and Chewbacca are trapped in the Death Star Trash Compactor.  It's your challenge to help them escape to the freedom of the Rebel Base.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;R2D2 spins out your moves, but you must decide what passage ways to follow.  The safe way is the long way.  And time is running out.  You must turn off the tractor beam and pick up a pair of secret plans.  Will you take short cuts that risk encounters with the Force?  You will if you're daring, and could be the first to board the Millennium Falcon, fight your way through Tie Fighters, and reach the rebel Base to win!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is one of two games released by Kenner almost concurrently with the original Star Wars movie (Star Wars: Destroy Death Star Game is the other).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player races through the Death Star with two tokens (Luke/Leia and Han/Chewbacca), picking up good/bad 'Force' cards when they land on blue spaces.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Both tokens must reach the Millennium Falcon and fight their way across TIE Fighters to win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Board features some cool prints from the movie as well as a great outside view of the Death Star.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Once you finish this game you can then breakout your 'Destroy Death Star Game' to launch your X-Wing assault and complete your Star Wars gaming experience!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>&amp;quot;This game is played by two people.  One commands the northern forces, the other commands the southern forces.  It is up to you as one of the commanders to develop the strategy and make the decisions which will give you the best chance to win.  The course of the war is in your hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the beginning of the year 1863, the Confederate and Union armies were closely balanced.  Either side could still win.  There were differences - the North had more troops while the South had better ones with more mobility.  But the decisive battles lay in the future.  Final victory would be determined by the same factors for the Union and the Confederacy alike: sufficient fighting strength in the right place at the right time, daring and clever tactics, and luck.  The players of this game must fight the same even fight.  The same skill, daring and luck are required of you, if you want to win.&amp;quot; - Taken from games rules introduction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;User review: There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry, and gunboats. Infantry can move one space on land each turn. Cavalry can move up to two spaces on land each turn. Gunboats may move up to two spaces each turn and may transport infantry. Units may move orthogonally and diagonally.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The gameboard is an 18 x 18 grid of squares. Starting places for the units, railroads, key cities, mountains, and important waterways are denoted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players alternate taking turns with the Confederate player moving first. Combat occurs when opposing forces occupy the same space. The rules are more detailed but a larger force always defeats the smaller force. A player forces the opponent to remove units from play by capturing any of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s key cities.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who eliminates all of the opponent&amp;rsquo;s units or gets the opponent to surrender is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;[27 December 2012] This game was first published in Life Magazine, volume 50 number 11, 17 March 1961. It was designed by three Life magazine staff members. This Parker Brothers edition was published subsequently, and is thus more accurately described as the second edition. Refer to the brief clip from Life magazine in the graphics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A standard deck playing card game played with a special layout (or board) and poker chips.  It is a modern version of the game of Poch.  Each hand has three phases: &amp;quot;Hearts&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Poker&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Michigan Rummy&amp;quot;.  All cards are dealt out, including one extra hand which remains unseen.  Players place chips in the spaces for the special combinations on the playing mat/board, the &amp;quot;Poker&amp;quot; pot, and the &amp;quot;Kitty&amp;quot;.  The first phase pays off for holding certain cards or combinations (that match the combinations on the playing layout/board).  The second phase is a hand of poker; each player selecting five cards from his hand to play.  A hand of Poker betting takes place, with bets added to the &amp;quot;Poker&amp;quot; pot, and the winner wins the &amp;quot;Poker&amp;quot; pot.  In the third phase, players play a slight variation of the game of Michigan (similar to Fan Tan), and the first to go out wins the chips in the &amp;quot;Kitty&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The book Games We Play pictures a version of Poch published in ~1830 in Nuremberg by Verlag Fr Scharrer.  From this illustration we can see the evolution of Pope Joan to Poch, which was further refined into the Tripoley we see today.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is a Public Domain game known as Michigan Rummy.  This name comes from the third phase where the standard deck playing card game of Michigan (&amp;quot;Stops Family&amp;quot;) is played.  Michigan Rummy should not be confused with the game of 500 Rum and its variation called Michigan Rum from the Rummy Family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The spots on the board are 10-J-Q-K-A of Hearts (5 spots), 8-9-10 all one suit (one spot), Q-K of Hearts (one spot), and the Kitty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Re-implements:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Pochspiel&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also see:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;    Michigan Rummy&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The third in the Fleet Series of 1980's era naval warfare, 7th Fleet's focus is the Pacific ocean from the Sea of Okhotsk to the northern Philippines and from the coast of China to Guam. Hexes are approx. 45 nautical miles across.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players maneuver task forces of ships and submarines along with air wings to attack the opposing force. All ships, subs, and aircraft have various ratings for surface-to-surface missile, anti-air, area anti-air, anti-sub, close defense, air-to-air, and torpedo combat as well as defense, movement, and detection ratings (subs only).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Units include numerous aircraft, ships, and sub types from mainly the US, Japan, Soviet Union, and China as well as miscellaneous units from Canada, Vietnam, North and South Korea, and Australia&amp;mdash;everything from F-15s to Romeo subs to Nimitz carriers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each 8-hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &amp;quot;Air&amp;quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players also use their units to attempt to &amp;quot;detect&amp;quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;About 15 scenarios are included which range from about 90 minutes to 3 or 4 hours. Several campaigns are included which can take days to play out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This is not to be confused with the 2001 release of the same name.  In this game, your job is to move your racer down a path past three successive stage finish lines.  Unknown to other racers, each player has a secret agenda as to where their racer is to finish (e.g. 1st in Stage 1, 3rd in Stage 2, 2nd in Stage 3).  If you accomplish your goals, you score points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is made up of five straight lanes, each a sequence of rectangular areas, and each rectangular subdivision has four dots of the racer's path (ie, ten consecutive rectangles will require dice-rolls totaling 40 to advance through).  Players also have a hand of four cards which conveniently overlay these rectangles and which have differing numbers of dots (from 0 to 8).  On a player's turn, he or she may play one of these overlaying cards on the board so as to make any player's path longer or shorter.  Then the player rolls the dice and moves his racer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; game, each player also has a hand of four action cards, some of which can be played on others and some of which can only be played on oneself.  These actions alter player's options (e.g. &amp;quot;play no cards,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;move 10 spaces rather than rolling&amp;quot;, etc).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The game starts by dealing out the entire deck of alphabet cards to the players, who place them face-up in front of themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After seeding the tray with a 4 or 5 letter word, a free-for-all ensues, where each player may play 1 or 2 of their letters to change the current word to another valid word (LIVE to LIKE, for example). Players who cannot create new words may steal letters from in front of other players, replacing them with any of their own.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The winner is the first to get rid of all their cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The educational (and the &amp;quot;Keep Quiet&amp;quot;) part of the game comes from the optional use of sign language alphabet symbols to replace the letter cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
