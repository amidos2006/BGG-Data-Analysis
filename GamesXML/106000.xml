In the game, players are rival traders in the fictional market town of Morgarhum.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players will draw and play cards representing goods of different values such as weapons, food, drink and accessories. Each goods card also has an action that is activated when played, allowing players to do such things as conceal goods, alter the value of goods on the market, or to have certain goods confiscated.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additional powerful abilities are available by bribing town officials and players must decide when or if to activate these.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players compete over three rounds to have the highest value goods on their market stall, with each round representing a day of trading.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description form the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>You've never played UNO like this before! Now with a Jurassic World theme, the rules are similar to those of regular UNO Attack, but this game features the &amp;quot;Attack! Attack!&amp;quot; command card that offers an exciting and unpredictable way to play UNO. If you draw that card you&amp;rsquo;ll have to push the button on the Dilophosaurus shooter, and you&amp;rsquo;ll either be the target of a stream of UNO Attack Jurassic World cards, or you will get lucky and nothing will happen! But if you&amp;rsquo;re not so lucky, the shooter will fire a stream of cards that you have to add to your hand! And when the shooter is launching cards, it makes a variety of funny sounds that add energy and silliness to the game. UNO Attack Jurassic World adds speed and surprise to the game because you never know when an attack is coming! The goal is still to get rid of all the cards in your hand, and when you&amp;rsquo;re down to one card, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to yell, &amp;ldquo;UNO!&amp;rdquo; Contains 112 cards, Dilophosaurus shooter, and instructions. The unit is both portable and designed to help with storage&amp;mdash;you can keep the cards right inside the shooter!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Now Jurassic World fans can play a special version of UNO Attack!:&amp;#10;The &amp;quot;Attack! Attack!&amp;quot; card - When this card is played, whoever played it gets to call any color and then choose ANY OTHER PLAYER in the game to &amp;ldquo;Attack.&amp;rdquo;  The Dilophosaurus Card Launcher is rotated to face the chosen player, and then &amp;ldquo;attacking&amp;rdquo; player gets to press down on the Dilophosaur&amp;rsquo;s nose twice.  The player being &amp;ldquo;attacked&amp;rdquo; must keep all the cards that come out of the launcher.  The game then continues with the next player in regular rotation (the second player to the left &amp;ndash; or right in Reverse rotation - of the player who played the Wild Attack-Attack card).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand, and the first player or team to 500 wins. When you&amp;rsquo;re down to one card, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to yell &amp;ldquo;UNO&amp;rdquo;!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The grape pickers are fighting to inherit a magnificent but nearly abandoned vineyard. Whoever is able to harvest the best grape yield from the vines will become the owner of this precious land.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The players advance along the board, collecting cards with the most interesting grapes. To collect the cards you advance along a track that represents the rows of a vineyard. Each track has a series of different grape cards on either side, and you are allowed to choose the cards next to the space you are on, or next to the space you move to. Each turn you can choose a card and advance or advance and choose a card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the track, there are different wineries (each preferring a different kind of grape variety). Get the best reward for your harvest from the local wineries by matching your hand of grapes with their needs. If the players go quickly, they may get the best cards, but risk not having enough grapes. If they go too slow, the competition can beat them to the best vines!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Selling your grapes to the wineries gets the players prestige points, and each player has a limited amount of deliveries. The end game triggers when a player makes their last grape delivery. The other players can finish moving through their track. Then, everyone counts their prestige points gained through their previous deliveries, and the player with the most points wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Paris is a 2-player board game by Jos&amp;eacute; Antonio Abascal infused with Parisian aesthetics by the boardgame&amp;rsquo;s artist Oriol Hern&amp;aacute;ndez. The game is set in late 19th century Paris during the 1889 &amp;ldquo;Exposition Universelle,&amp;rdquo; or world&amp;rsquo;s fair, when public electricity was a hot topic. Electricity spread throughout the city, creating today&amp;rsquo;s beautiful nocturnal Parisian streets and coining Paris&amp;rsquo;s nickname &amp;ldquo;La Cit&amp;eacute; de la Lumi&amp;eacute;re&amp;rdquo;, the city of lights.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The most well-lit buildings are admired more highly by passers-by. In the first phase, players can either place tiles or grow their reserve of buildings. The cobblestone tiles are divided into 4 random spaces (their color, their opponents&amp;rsquo; color, a streetlight or a mixed-color space where either player can build).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Then, in the second phase, players build on top of their color or the mixed spaces, in effort to position their buildings as close to as many streetlights as possible. More streetlights solicit more adoration and points. The player with the best lit buildings steals the hearts of Parisian pedestrians and wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Each family forages for themselves, trying to do the best for the wee offspring. The first to fill their little sack will be the envy of all mousedom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ratzzia is a game for two to five players. The dice represent the mice in each player&amp;rsquo;s family. Each time they roll the dice they must arrange the die results on the board in order to get as much food as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player has their own set of colored dice. On their turn, they roll their dice and choose to place them on the matching spaces on the board. The dice represent mice climbing on top of each other in order to get rewards from the top shelf.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rewards can be delicious food, or actions that help you store or steal food. After collecting some food, it needs to be stored, otherwise it can be stolen by other players! As soon as a player gets 25 points worth of food, they win the game and survive the winter!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, &amp;quot;The Ides of March are come&amp;quot;, implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied &amp;quot;Aye, Caesar; but not gone.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are members of the Senate and must plot in favor or against the magnicide of Julius Caesar. But is not that easy, they need to identify who shares their convictions in order to partnership against the other players, and be careful with whom only look for their wealth.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are four roles that are dealt every turn: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     The &amp;quot;Consul&amp;quot; take the decision of who will play in the active round and distribute the rest of the roles.&amp;#10;     There are two &amp;quot;Edils&amp;quot; that will vote, secretly, if the Caesar will life or die.&amp;#10;     At last, the &amp;quot;Praetor&amp;quot; will decide to sneak a peek one of the two votes and can force that &amp;quot;Edil&amp;quot; to change his vote.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Once all the players voted twice, they reveal his votes and check if the Caesar will live or die.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But the decisions are not that easy. At the beginning of the game, players will take two different cards of their &amp;quot;team&amp;quot; (in favor, against, or to be neutral in the &amp;quot;magnicide&amp;quot;) and they must discard one of these cards before the second round of votes take place in order to choose their final team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>For the 20th anniversary of Roads &amp;amp; Boats, it is being reprinted for the 5th time. This edition will include the expansion, &amp;amp;Cetera, so it can be played with up to 6 players and you will get all the additional modules of &amp;amp;Cetera included in the game. There are no other changes to the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Roads &amp;amp; Boats, each player builds a civilization over a long period of time, like in many other games. Unlike most games, however, the emphasis is not on warfare, population growth, city or statebuilding, but on logistics, or rather: on transport.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts the game with three donkeys, a pile of wooden boards, a number of stones and two geese. With these few resources, you try to build such diverse things as woodcutters, roads, boats, mines, a stock exchange... but beware! There is no concept of territory in this game: you cannot own land, nor buildings, so the things you build can be used by any other player...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The original game can be played by two to four players, but it can also be used as a one-person puzzle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;amp;Cetera adds new buildings, new goods, new land types, new transporters, new ways to win and new strategies. It also includes 24 new scenarios and material to play with 5 or 6 players. &amp;amp; Cetera contains all the rules and material previously published as Planes &amp;amp; Trains, plus a lot more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Unlike the classic card game, Mau Mau - the board game is not just about getting rid of your cards quickly and saying Mau Mau - it's about get as many points as possible. Shouting Mau Mau doesn't end the game, but gives you 5 bonus points. Playing identical cards and some special spaces also wins bonus points. The game ends when all the spaces on the board are covered with cards. The winner of this fast-paced board game version of the classic card game is the player who scored the most points!&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the back of the box&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Draw two on the 7, skip a turn on the 8 - the famous card game mau mau gets its own special charm as a board game. Anyway, if Reiner Knizia takes over the implementation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Placing a suitable card on another, the next player must react - this is the classic principle of mau mau. The suit or number must match the previously placed card. Reiner Knizia has transferred this principle to the game board: tiles are placed on a path. The color or symbol shown must match the adjacent tile. Special fields provide surprise effects. And the classics such as &amp;quot;two draw&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;skip&amp;quot; are also present here. For the penultimate card, announce &amp;quot;mau&amp;quot;; for the last card, &amp;quot;mau mau&amp;quot; also applies. However: &amp;quot;mau mau&amp;quot; is not the end. But only when all fields on the map are occupied. This creates tension: the winner is not who got rid of his cards first, but who has collected the most points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;So it is important to proceed strategically and reach the special fields, because they certainly lead to the coveted point chips. In addition, you usually have several investment options.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description form the publisher (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Dicey Crafting is a single player, dungeon crawling, dice rolling adventure game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The gameplay consists of a deck of monsters that you must battle your way through to complete the game. You also have a weapon (how you attack) and a shield (your health) that are crafted out of dice. These gear pieces lose durability (the number decreases on them) as you attack enemies and they attack you. As a gear piece wears out you can 'mine' dice from a dice mine, roll them, and re-craft your weapon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game time is between 30 to 45 mins. You can build the monster deck smaller for a shorter game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The rounds are arranged in the form of a comic strip.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

If it is owned, then they must play the owner rent money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If they land on &amp;quot;Tough Luck&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Jackpot&amp;quot; card spots, the player takes a card from the corresponding card pile and follows the instructions on the chosen card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The unique aspect of the game is that if you land on a &amp;quot;Casino&amp;quot; spot, then the player plays a Casino &amp;quot;mini-game.&amp;quot; There are four mini-games: Roulette, Black Jack, Craps, and slots. (The game comes with a small roulette wheel, and dice to replicate slot machines.) Players can place bets on these games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to reach $35,000 (or the person with the most money after a set amount of time) is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The card game Top That! is a new type of game that takes the process of getting to know your fellow human and makes it a fun, often insightful, experience. The game is meant to appeal to just about anyone from any background, and can be used as an ice breaker or as a tool to get people to open up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Top That! is a deck of cards where each card has a topic on it. Along with each topic, there's a caption that is meant to spark ideas for responses to the topic, or in many cases the caption is just meant to get a chuckle out of the players to help lighten to mood. Topics are things like, &amp;quot;Your Worst Day at School&amp;quot;, where each person is expected to recount their worst day at school story. The game has some hidden strategies, where it's not always about what stories are told, but sometimes how entertaining they are when told.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of each round of game play, each player votes for their favorite response without voting on their own, and the person with the most votes wins the round. If there's a tie, then you have a tiebreaker round between those that tied, responding to a new topic card. The game continues until you hit a predetermined number of cards, or you all call it quits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The deadliest martial arts experts have gathered in a secret arena to engage the ultimate stealth assassin showdown. As each is evenly matched in strength, skill, and speed, only cunning and courage will tell who will be the last one standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ninjas!! The Stealth Assassin Showdown is a battle royale board game for 2 to 4 players, who use deduction to find and strike moving opponents while trying to evade attacks themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played on a 10-by-10 grid, and involves playable Move and Attack cards, as well as Ninja Star and Footprint tokens. Each player begins with the same hand of 12 cards--the 12 Styles of Ninja, which depict and describe the strategies in the ninja's toolbox, and which can be used to help find, hit, or dodge opponents. Turns alternate between Moves and Attacks, in which all players plan secretly, and then reveal and resolve simultaneously. Players record their own turns and track evidence of their opponents' movements in writing on a Notepad.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Although the in-game goals remain the same for every game of Ninjas!!, players can change the end-game conditions to allow for different game times and styles of gameplay. The standard game involved 3 wounds and player elimination, other options include Sudden Death matches as well as point-based games in which players count the number of successful attacks against the number of times they were wounded. Each game of Ninjas!! can also be played on a differently laid out board and with different starting positions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Set in a post apocalyptic world destroyed by climate change, Tremor is a 2 to 4 player medium weight strategy game where you redesign and rearrange the board every turn.  As an animal spirit guide, to win you must exploit a disaster-ridden world to help your species progress, while hindering your opponents. The goal is to save your species by helping them reach their last remaining natural habitat in the opposite corner of the board, before your rivals get to theirs.&amp;#10;&amp;#226;&amp;#128;&amp;#139;&amp;#10;Tremor is played on a modular tile board. On your turn you must take 3 actions in any order: Traverse, Tectonic Twist, and Scout (a choice of component actions Explore and Forecast).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These actions allow players to move across the board towards their goal, reorient tiles, and accumulate Tremor Tokens. Tremor Tokens are placed on the separate Catastrophe Board, and players must strategically allocate and optimise them to ignite a disaster.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 6 disasters that will help or hinder your passage to safety. Each of them have unique effects, and the area of the board they affect is based on how you manipulate their position and orientation. You can also evade, combo and amplify their effects by using secret Catastrophe Cards, Disaster Die rolls, and abilities unique to your species.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tremor can be played as a competitive or co-operative game. It's easy to learn and hard to master, making it suitable for all skill levels. Games last between 30-90 minutes depending on how seriously you take your strategy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash; Jonah, Curly Bros Games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In the colorful chamber of the Castle of Mind, two players clash. The players command colored pawns on the stone floor of the castle. The goal is to reach the middle of the field with the red pawn - and to stop the opponent from doing the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game holds many opportunities. It is up to the players&amp;rsquo; decisions, what roles their pawns fulfill, where and when they strike, how they defend and how they switch tactics during the battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What makes the encounter especially exciting, is the unique game mechanism, which enables that movement and conflict does not happen at the same place. &amp;#10;This simple but brilliant twist in the gameplay requires that the players&amp;rsquo; attention covers the whole board and to try to think ahead of the opponent, keeping several versions in mind. This stimulates the players to think and to develop their thinking.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thus the encounter takes place in the minds of the two players. The colored pawns commanded on the colorful floor of the castle of mind represent this challenge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Castle of Mind is a two-player logic-strategy board game where players move colored pieces on a board of colored fields, aiming to eliminate the enemy's red pieces while reaching the red field in the middle of the board with one of their own red piece. The game's specialty is it's game mechanic: the strike by a piece to another does not happen where the actual move occurs!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Portuguese King as called the finest stonemasons of the country to pave one of the most important squares with cal&amp;ccedil;ada tiles (worldwide famous black and white tiles that pave several squares in Portugal).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is a stonemason who will try to position his pieces on the best spots of the square in order to maximize his score...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;... however, you will not only build your tiles. In fact, most of the times you will have to build other player's tiles in the square!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players have a personal board, where they will place the tiles they collect from the quarry precisely in the order as they came out of the quarry. So when a player builds, he has the build the leftmost tile on his board and so on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;But fear not, some helpers will give a hand by breaking the game's rules. Every player starts the game with a hand of 5 helpers which they will be able to recruit during the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each helper not only will bend the game's rules when activated, but they will also give points if certain types of patterns are built on the square with the player's pieces. So when you recruit a helper, you're not only building an engine of special powers but a scoring engine for the game's end.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game constantly pitches you against the decision of when and how to build: &amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Build less to avoid building other player's pieces on the board, but you get less money and you won't be able to recruit and activate the helpers you need. &amp;#10;     Build a lot but you'll probably be helping your opponent's more than you wished.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Super Punch Fighter is a game of arena battle and video-game powers for 1-6 players. Choose a fighter, grab their deck, and start knocking your opponents off the stage. Each knockout earns you a star, and grabbing an achievement card earns you extra stars. The first player to reach nine stars wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, each turn players can use any of the button cards in front of them to gain extra movement, draw more cards, perform extra attacks, and block damage from opponents. Every time you press a button, you put a thumb token on that button card to show it's been used. You can press as many buttons as you like, but you can remove tokens from at most four cards at the end of your turn. Every other card with a thumb token still on it is then discarded, so pick your buttons wisely!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aside from mashing buttons, you can play cards from your hand by paying the button cost of the card. Fighter cards are powerful and unique to your fighter. You can play multiple fighter cards on your turn as long as you have the buttons to pay for them, and if the last button on a fighter card matches the first button on the next card you play, you need to put a thumb token on that button only once! Pick the best cards to string together for a super-powered hit!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Super Punch Fighter includes a 1-2 co-operative mode called &amp;quot;Minion Rush&amp;quot; in which waves of minions try to overwhelm the board. Total your stars at the end to determine your rank, from lowly amateur to grand champion.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A straight-forward adaptation of the card game Canasta into a word game.  Instead of clustering traditional cards into melds of identical rank, lettered cards are melded into words.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Alphanasta deck consists of two packs of 54 cards, which combined include: 40 vowels, 48 consonants, 8 doubles (e.g. J/K or  W/X, where you can use it as either letter), 8 pairs (e.g. ER or ED, where both letters are used in the printed order, and 4 triples (ING). Vowels are worth 5 points each, consonants 10, doubles and pairs 20, and triples 50.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is dealt 13 cards each, or 11 in partnership games. In a turn a player: &amp;#10;1. Draws: either A) the top of the draw pile, or B) the entire discard pile. B) can only be done if the top discard is used to extend an existing word, or meld a new word of 4+ letters using cards from the hand. &amp;#10;2. May do this as much as they wish: A) meld new words from the hand of 4+ letters; B) add cards to either end of an tabled word of theirs, making it a new word. &amp;#10;3. Discards a card from the hand, unless they are going out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Doubles, pairs, and triples are considered Wild cards for the purposes of impure words (it's impure if it ends in a Wild); and of freezing the discard pile (which cannot be drawn unless the top card is used for a new word of 5+ letters rather than 4+).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A player or team may go out if they have at least two Word Canastas (words of 7+ letters), or one Alphanasta (a word of 10+ letters played from the hand).  At this point all players score the sum of the letter values in the words they have on the table, plus these bonuses: &amp;#10;100 points for going out&amp;#10;300 an impure Word Canasta &amp;#10;500 a pure Words Canasta&amp;#10;1000 an Alphanasta&amp;#10;100 for each letter over 7 in a Word Canasta.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to reach 3000 points over several hands, or 5000 for partnership games, wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Dragons of Thruduit is an LCG game where you battle with elemental dragons!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Object of the game: in order to win you need to defeat all the opponents dragons. This can be done in any assortment of ways, but will be discussed later.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dragons of Thruduit&amp;rsquo;s play has phases to it. &amp;#10;1: draw phase&amp;#10;2: level phase&amp;#10;3: play phase&amp;#10;4: attack phase &amp;#10;5: resolve phase&amp;#10;6: end phase&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Draw phase-&amp;#10;During the draw phase each player draws a single card. The player who goes first does not get to draw a card on their first turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Level phase-&amp;#10;For this phase each player gains soul tokens equal to their head dragon's soul cost. You can only have a max soul count of 20. If you go above this, just take 20.&amp;#10;Now each player can choose to level up. If you have 10 souls then you can spend them in order to gain one level. Each player starts at level one.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Play phase-&amp;#10;You may now play cards. If you wish to play a card there are a few requirements you must meet. You must be that card&amp;rsquo;s level or higher, and you must also pay that&amp;rsquo;s card soul cost. If you do both of these things then you can play the card. After you play a card, remove soul tokens from your soul pool according to the cards soul cost. Example: if you play a card that costs 5 souls, you must remove 5 soul tokens. You can only play 3 cards onto the field a single play phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Attack Phase-&amp;#10;The first player will now attack. The player can choose any number of dragons to attack. Your dragon can only attack at an opponent&amp;rsquo;s dragon with a lower than or equal level to that dragon. Once you attack that dragon its health decreases by the attacking dragons damage value. You may attack with any number of dragons on the board as long as they can fulfill the requirements above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-Resolve phase-&amp;#10;Both players now remove health counters from all their dragons that took damage this turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-End Phase-&amp;#10;Your turn ends and your opponent's turn starts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Each other player shouts out guesses for the word. At any time before the timer runs out, if 2 or more players agree to see another letter, the Word Hider reveals another letter, and the guessing continues.  Once a player correctly guesses the word, the Word Hider says &amp;quot;That's it&amp;quot; and reveals the word; the player who guessed it keeps all the cards that were hidden when the correct guess was made. If no correct guess is made, the Word Hider keeps all the letters of the word.  Unclaimed cards are discarded, and Word Hider fills their hand back to 8 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players keep taking turns being the Word Hider until the deck runs out and no one can make a word from their hand. At that point, the player with the most cards won from guesses is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The timer is turned, and each player turns their letters face up, arranges them into a 4x4 grid, and moves them around to form the longest word they can find. When time runs out, if the word is valid, they keep the letters used, and the rest are returned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After 4 rounds, the player with the most kept letters wins. Play can be varied in difficulty with more or fewer letters, or in length with more or fewer rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Wordage has two identical decks; one deck is used for 2-4 players, both decks for 5-8 players. Each deck has: 3 A's and E's, 2 O's, I's and S's, and 1 of each other letter, all in red, and the same again all in black, plus two Joiner cards that can stand for any letter, making 68 cards. Each letter has a point value of 1-5.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is dealt 14 cards (children 10 cards), and during their turn a player draws a card, lays down cards if possible, and discards a card. The initial lay-down must be one or more words that have at least 14 points in value and include at least one 5+ letter word in one color (for children, at least 10 points and no color requirement). A word's value is the sum of its letters' values, plus bonuses for length, doubled if the word is of one color.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In turns after the initial lay-down, a player may also: draw the top discard instead of the top of the deck; add letters to any word on the table instead of playing a new word (this doesn't score points, though); replace a Joiner (wild) card with the letter it currently stands from from the hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who plays all the cards in their hand except one which is then discarded, wins the round. The game is won by the first player to win two rounds consecutively; for shorter games, the consecutive requirement is dropped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the party version of the game, points for words played are tallied and totaled -- a score pad is included -- and a round's winner gets a bonus of 50 points plus the values of the cards left in others' hands.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

It includes 22 vowel cards, 33 consonant cards, a tray, and sand timer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a player's turn they turn up 9 cards from the vowel and consonant decks, with the balance of vowels and consonants up to them. They then turn the timer and everyone writes down words they can form from the revealed cards, trying to come up with the longest word.  When time is up, the player with the longest word scores the length of their word; tied players all score. The winner is the player with the highest score after an agreed number of rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are also rules for a Word Count Game. The mechanics are the same, but players score for every word they write down: &amp;#10;1 pt - 3 letters&amp;#10;2 pts - 4 letters&amp;#10;3 pts - 5 letters&amp;#10;5 pts - 6-8 letters&amp;#10;10 pts - 9 letters&amp;#10;The highest score after the agreed number of rounds wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Players will make a choice of how much risk they are going to take in flipping the pancakes by flicking one, two or three pancake cards with their fingers and catching them again. Different markers on the cards indicate different levels of risk. The higher the risk, the more difficult the flip, the more points to win &amp;ndash; and to lose, of course.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As competing chefs, players will have to interfere with their fellow co-chefs&amp;rsquo; pancake flips and also steal their nicest creations to their advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the right combination of pancakes and the highest points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from artist&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Pawikan Patrol is an action-selection, light deduction strategy game set in a coastal community where players send Characters to the Beach to find the location of Pawikan (sea turtles) and their nests, while keeping the Poacher away from them. Along the way, players must also clean up Trash and make sure that the natural Predator of the sea turtles is kept safe from harm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a player's turn, they will choose a Character card from their hand and move it to one of the five face-down Beach cards on the Beach; in response, the Poacher card will also move to a new Beach card based on the number of arrows indicated on the Character. After moving, Beach cards in the same column as your Character and the Poacher are turned face-up at the same time: if they have the matching icon on the Beach card, they are collected; cards collected by Characters are put into their player's collection area; meanwhile, cards collected by the Poacher are discarded. If they do not have the matching icon, the cards are returned face-down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Characters have special abilities that allow the player to gather information from the Beach or the Beach Deck, manipulate the position of cards in different zones, or negate the Poacher's ability to collect cards before you do. Players must be careful with their choice of Character to send on any particular turn, because once they move to the Beach, they have to wait they only have one Character in hand to regain the use of all their other Characters; timing their movement can be very important.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the most number of points at the end of the game wins and is declared the Pawikan Patrol Leader; however, if they are they are careless enough to allow the Poacher to take away a certain number of turtles or eggs, ALL players can lose the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In this in-hand, cards-only solo deck management game, you are a runner who went for a morning jog in the wrong labyrinth. Now, three doors and a rampaging Minotaur stand between you and the escape tunnel at the center of the maze.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your goal as the player is to find and discard all three door cards from the deck before you discard three Minotaur cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, you'll choose to uncover either the left or right side of the next card in the deck, and the side you reveal will have a symbol that tells you whether you'll need to turn the card you moved before placing it back in the deck. Then choose one of two possible locations to place the card back in the deck, and repeat with the next card until you either escape...or fall to the Minotaur.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With convenient in-hand play, simple but deep deck management, dynamically scaling difficulty, three game modes to try, and easy pausing, this is a deathtrap you'll never want to leave home without!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Originally conceived as a set of &amp;ldquo;large scale skirmish&amp;rdquo; rules for the Indian Mutiny, MD&amp;amp;E is easily adapted for other theatres and periods. These rules will easily manage skirmishes and battles between European and any native forces. The rules will even work if you want to pit a colonial German force against the French Foreign Legion, or for that matter, the British in South Africa against the Boers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For the most part, the disparity in weapon technology offsets the fact that the Europeans are often heavily outnumbered, even though newer rifles meant superior range and firepower, in each theatre these new weapons were not universal. In fact, the British and other colonial powers often relied on locally raised allies, or levies, to do most of the fighting for them. The British had a habit of issuing local troops with weapons that were one or two developments behind their European counterparts. In far flung theatres, the replacement of seemingly obsolete weapons took some time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game mechanics are straightforward. All movement is randomized by using dice and you lose movement dice for bad terrain. It is easier to move and control units if there is a commander present. Firing and combat is based on the number of figures, plus or minus relevant factors. Damage either kills a figure or inflicts terror on the unit. Morale tests are triggered by extreme situations, or the gradual buildup of terror.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules are designed to be quick, capable of handling battles from forty or fifty figures a side to several hundred. They have worked well on a standard home-sized 10 x 6 or a monstrous 45 x 6 and have been &amp;ldquo;crash tested&amp;rdquo; by over 100 wargamers from a dozen different countries.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Inspired by the legends of Gilgamesh and childhood adventure films like The Goonies, The Epic of Gil &amp;amp; Ennis is a dice-rolling and management game for 1 or 2 players, playable in 15 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, 1 or 2 players, as Gil and Ennis will move through four phases on each turn: Hike, Pitch, Sleep, and Break. In the Hike phase, they will advance to a new campsite on the map, on their way to the final Mount Humbaba space. They will make camp during the Pitch phase, manipulating their dice as they prepare for the coming night. During the Sleep phase they decide whether to dream alone or together, and will then spend dice to overcome Dream cards, gaining Insight or giving in to Worry. In the morning, they will Break camp, depleting supplies and foraging for dice. All along, players will be managing their dice through character abilities and Insights, as they try to keep the mounting Worry level at bay. Players win if they reach the Mount Humbaba space of the map and meet the dice values of the final challenge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Played with a combination of dice and cards, the Epic of Gil &amp;amp; Ennis was originally an entry into the 2019 9 Card Design Contest.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Odkrywcy kultur is a game of cultural discovery that takes you around the world in just 40 minutes!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We all love to travel, explore exotic civilizations, and gain a greater understanding of the cultural heritage of others. But discovery isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy, and there&amp;rsquo;s always that chance that missteps might offend rather than open doors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Did your host in Japan reach for her samurai sword when you plunged your chopsticks into the rice bowl? Did the guys in an English pub take a swing at you after you gestured to the bartender asking for two beers?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Odkrywcy kultur takes players to new and exciting places around the world while showing them how to behave to avoid confusion, conflicting signals, and even real danger. During the game, participants visit all continents and discover hundreds of unwritten rules of social behavior: how to gesture acceptance in India, what to avoid in Egypt during Ramadan, and how to successfully conduct business negotiations in Brazil.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Odkrywcy kultur is a unique mix of a modern board game and a handbook on cross-cultural communications. As players race to pick up souvenirs across the globe, they must think tactically to plan their trip, quiz others on potential cultural faux pas, and quickly react to opponents&amp;rsquo; moves. As with any game, a bit of luck always helps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When players correctly answer an opponent&amp;rsquo;s question they win chips with souvenirs and can then travel to another country, opening a treasure chest of knowledge about the new region. The game&amp;rsquo;s questions were designed and arranged to offer interesting and practical information about our &amp;ldquo;global village&amp;rdquo; during play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules of Odkrywcy kultur were designed by Karol Madaj, designer of 303 as well as Kolejka (Queue) and Lukasz M. Pogoda. The questions and answers in Odkrywcy kultur were drawn from the decades of travel experience and cultural exploration of Halina Grzymala-Moszczynska, PhD, professor of Jagiellonian University in Cracow, and Witold Sekudewicz, the game&amp;rsquo;s author and managing director of The Link School of Foreign Languages and Intercultural Communications. Mr. Sekudewicz and Ms. Grzymala-Moszczynska worked closely with a panel of widely traveled experts from universities on five continents in creating the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Odkrywcy kultur is a must for anyone with an interest in our multicultural world and a love of sharing fun and excitement with friends and family. It&amp;rsquo;s a great pastime for both seasoned explorers and those who only dream about faraway places. Also, it is a storehouse of practical knowledge for any business traveler: Don&amp;rsquo;t risk a blunder and failed deals because you misread the signals when you&amp;rsquo;re away from home.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before you buy your plane, train, or boat tickets, learn how to sidestep unpleasant situations and awkward apologies and avoid offending your hosts. Yes, even a journey of 10,000 miles begins with a single step. Odkrywcy kultur is the step you&amp;rsquo;ll want to take first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A Gentleman's War is a simple game involving toy soldiers of the classic style. It is a relaxed and relaxing game, where enough depends on the turn of a card and the roll of a handful of dice to say that our disasters are pure chance, but enough cunning decision-making to claim our victories as acts of brilliant generalship.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Our model soldiers are very brave, obedient, and generally do what we want them to. Players are expected to behave in a friendly manner, and conduct themselves as gentlemen (or ladies, as is appropriate). There are lots of six-sided dice, saving rolls, proper distances in inches, and a general sense that there ought to be salmon-and-cucumber sandwiches and tea, or&amp;#10;beer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Build your city wherever you want! At home, on the train, on the plane. As the name says, Micro City is a small game about building your city. Several game modes, various challenges, different levels of difficulty and random distribution of districts will make each game different!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your goal will vary depending on the mode chosen, but it&amp;rsquo;s all about building structures that you will pay for with materials gained with your actions. You only have a certain number of rounds to reach your goal, so plan every move carefully.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Micro City second edition introduces 2 completely new game modes and several changes to the base game. It&amp;rsquo;s still primarily a solitaire game but now you can also play against another player or face challenges together in a 2 or 3 player coop mode.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Micro City you start of by rolling 2 dice. You then play on of the cards on your hand and resolve its effects. Each card causes your builder to move through the city and perform an action - either basic or an advanced one which requires a correct die. You then gain benefits from the city tile your builder ends up on. Be careful as each tile action uses one of your investment tokens and blocks that tile until the investment token is removed. Also bare in mind that you have a certain amount of time to fulfill your current objective so plan your moves wisely!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Skyline Express - the first aerial train needs a manager. Manage your carriage as best as you can by properly placing passengers, offering them services and paying attention to their individual preferences. Prove that you are the right person to manage the Skyline Express!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skyline Express is a low enter family board game. On your turn pick a passenger from the waiting line and place him in your carriage. Sounds easy, right? Not necessarily. In order to win you need to concentrate and control the constantly changing situation on the board. Observing the actions of other players, adjusting your strategy to the current round and making sure you fill individual passengers preferences shows that becoming a manager of an aerial train is not an easy task.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game uses familiar mechanisms such as pattern building, set collection, tile placement and action selection and merges them into a fun experience for everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s sure to appeal to fans of games such as Azul, Sagrada and Reef.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points after 3 rounds. At the end of every round each player sums up all the points he earned in 3 different ways:&amp;#10;GOALS&amp;#10;SERVICES&amp;#10;VIP passengers&amp;#10;On his turn a player picks a passenger from the current waiting line and places him in his carriage. Additionally, the player may also use 1 of the available action slots and obtain 1 service card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are 6 types of passengers in the game. The white colored passenger is considered a VIP and has a specific VIP card that goes along with him. The VIP card indicates where the VIP would like to be seated and what passengers he&amp;rsquo;d like to sit with. Fulfill the VIPs preferences and earn big points!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every round has 2 goals that give victory points if fulfilled.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For every full compartment the player receives a service token. Once the player has 2 service tokens he can then spend them to buy a service card. A service card gives victory points for every pair of passengers in the colors shown on the card.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A round ends once all passengers from the waiting room have been placed in the players carriages. Players sum up their victory points and the next round begins with new passengers filling up the waiting room. Game ends after the scoring phase of round 3. The player with the most victory points becomes the manager of the Skyline Express.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Nubia is a solitaire game where you rule a Black African civilization of three Christian kingdoms in the Nile Valley: Nobadia, Makuria, and Alodia. Your culture is an heir to the glories of Ancient Egypt and the legendary Kingdom of Kush, but long gone are the days when you were conquering and ruling Egypt. In the game, it is A.D. 1172 and Nubia is under siege! For 400 years, you will battle to defend civilization against the fierce pagans of the Funj, and a jihad of marauding land-hungry Arabs. Deploy your famous archers, build fortified monasteries, send the Crown Prince into battle, and marry off your daughters in a desperate effort to stem the tide.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This fast-play, fun, and educational solitaire game uses a system created by Darin Leviloff. &amp;ldquo;Mek&amp;rdquo; markers on five converging paths represent hostile Arab and pagan armies that surround your kingdoms. The paths all meet in Soba, your fabulously wealthy capital at the juncture of the Blue and White Nile rivers, where the danger of a &amp;ldquo;Collapse&amp;rdquo; exists if any of those armies makes it that far. In addition, three tracks representing medieval Nubian society (Nobility, Kingship, and the Army) greatly impact the overall situation. A card draw determines which paths and tracks move against you this turn, while the cards teach you about the history of ancient and medieval Nubia. The number of &amp;ldquo;Efforts&amp;rdquo; which you can use to move them back in your favor (if the Effort die roll succeeds) depends on the personal talents of your current Uru (king) and his chief advisor, the Metropolitan Bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Managing Efforts is key to the game, and you never have as many as you want. You can obtain more by selling off land and using your bishops for political gain instead of their natural religious calling: a short term strategy that can cost you victory points in the end. Each risky gambit is aimed at averting a system-wide social collapse, which can end the game suddenly. Your success (or failure) in holding off the five hostile armies helps determine how many noble families are still on your side when a Collapse approaches, so the better you play the game, the less chance the Collapse gets off the ground.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As the game draws to a close, the Portuguese are searching Africa for the fabled Christian &amp;ldquo;Kingdom of Prester John.&amp;rdquo; Those legends may refer to you! Can you hold medieval Nubia together long enough to make contact with them and win the game?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Throw bubbles, seek out treasure and martial those hedgehogs as you prepare to play dirty for some good clean fun!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Aim of the Game:&amp;#10;Be the last duck standing by Destroying your opponents&amp;rsquo; bubble forts. This is done by landing three bubbles on forts of the same colour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overview: Each player starts with a number of Bubble Forts in play and a hand of six cards. These cards are either Bubbles (which can be played on other players Forts so long as they match colour) or Treasure cards (these will be items that help you defend yourself or hinder you opponents' plays).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns playing a card from their hand, with opponents reacting with their own Treasure cards. Any time a Bubble Fort has 3 or more Bubbles on it, it pops and gives the owner extra cards to play with. But if all of your Forts are popped, you are out! The winner is the last player standing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
