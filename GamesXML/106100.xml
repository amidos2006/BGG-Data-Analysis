						               													<description>Sanctum, once a great city, is now the last beacon of light in a world shrouded in darkness. The lands surrounding the city are home to the demon horde lead by the Lord of Demons. It's up to a handful of heroes to rise up, battle through the horde, banish the evil that plagues the world, and restore the realm to its former glory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sanctum is an epic adventure competitive game for 2-4 players that's inspired by the hack &amp;amp; slash genre and converted into a modern board game. As one of the heroes, you embark upon a quest to rid the land of a demonic invasion, fighting your way through countless enemies and gearing up to face the Lord of Demons himself. In the process of venturing deeper into the land, ever so much closer to the Demon Lord, the heroes have to improve their equipment and adapt their combat tactics to face the increasing difficulty of combat.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The seemingly simple dice-throwing mechanism turns out to be a tactical delicacy once you realize that equipping the correct gear is a crucial part of surviving in these hostile lands...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Welcome to Fantasy Ranch! Kick off your boots and pull up a chair for a game where all your dreams of owning a beautiful ranch with a stable full of horses can come true. Take real-life ranching to the tabletop as you choose from a wide variety of actual horses, hire highly skilled hands, and expand your property by laying claim to some of the most beautiful land in the west.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With 3 levels of difficulty, Fantasy Ranch is a great game whether you're a greenhorn or grizzled. So saddle up your dream horse, compete in the most thrilling competitions, and use your winnings to build yourself the perfect Fantasy Ranch!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fantasy Ranch is played over 5 rounds simulating a horse show season. Each round you will go to shows and try to build your ranch into the best around. Start by drafting a stable of 4 Horse cards. Choose from one of 6 double sided Ranch tiles where your horses will live - watch your stable grow with custom horse meeples.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn select from 3 different actions to continue building your ranch. You can buy land,&amp;nbsp; buy more horses or farm your ranch. Build up your property from a simple homestead to a wealthy land owner. Don't buy more than you can control or your neighbor might decide to move in and take it over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hire employees which give you additional actions or powers to help you meet your goals. Twist of Fate cards give you rewards if you can complete the requirements but act fast since other players could beat you to them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Win shows by rolling dice based on your horses' show skills. Horses with more training will have an advantage but the dice represents how unpredictable horses can be!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Win trophies by collecting sets of horses, competing Twist of Fate, owning land, completing ranches, and taking over other players' property! The game mixes area control with resource management to create a light weight fun intro game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bonus Game! The Trail Ride: &amp;#10;Here at the Ranch, we know just how hard it can be to corral all of those younger buckaroos so we've included The Trail Ride where kids can either set out on their own or you can play with them. This game lets kids become the trail boss by making choices to compete in shows, raise foals, and buy and trade horses. With 3 skill levels, The Trail Ride can be played with children as young as 5 years of ages. It's a game that grows with your kid!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Sabotage was designed and illegally distributed by a group of Danish resistance fighters during the German occupation of Denmark which lasted from 1940-45. It simulates an actual act of sabotage that took place against a transformer station at the Scandia Locomotive Factory in Randers on 6 July, 1943. Erik Hagen, a medical practitioner who was also active in the resistance underground, is said to have sold the game to his patients and donated the money to illegal activities and operations. He was shot and killed on 6 June, 1944, while returning from a sabotage mission against the Globus Factory in Glostrup.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game pits 1-2 saboteurs against 1-2 factory guards, and challenges the saboteurs to blow up as many machines and buildings as they can before they are either caught, killed, or manage to escape. The saboteurs will have to acquire the necessary equipment, such as crowbars, guns, and explosives, on the black market before entering the factory grounds and setting the charges. The factory guards, on the other hand, are trying to discover the saboteurs and raise the alarm. Once raised, the saboteurs only have a few turns to complete their operations and escape the factory grounds before the police arrives and arrests them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game board and pieces are printed on a single sheet of paper which players are instructed to mount on cardboard and cut out. Movement is controlled by the throw of a single 6-sided die, as are the gun fights which may occur if the guards discover the saboteurs. Considering the relative simplicity of the game, the simulational approach of the design sometimes makes for complicated situations which are only partly covered by the accompanying rules sheet. This also means that there are no hard and fast criteria for winning or losing. Rather, the game presents itself as a training simulation meant to inspire further acts of sabotage against the German occupying force.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Unofficial Persona 5 Phan-Game (UP5P) is a short game, taking around 30 minutes to complete. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty small in scale; you can play solo or co-op with a friend, and it&amp;rsquo;s only played using a few decks of cards and some tokens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You get to choose one Phantom Thief to play as (even Akechi makes the roster), and then in very Persona fashion you have to make some hard choices, because each turn&amp;mdash;represented by a day of the month&amp;mdash;you can only do one thing. Players can go recruit confidants (like Shinya, Miishima and Iwai) to gain perks, go to school to increase social stats, explore locations around them or make a run on the palace, defeating shadows in combat and trying to reach the boss.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This recreates the exact same stresses as Atlus&amp;rsquo; game. How do you best invest the time given to you? If you spend too long getting ready you might not clear the palace in time, but if you rush the palace unprepared you might screw things up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;Description from Luke Plunkett, Kotaku&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Rules: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-NEmSw3MUyKdrZzekDvAlEKFjnFg3QVi7h1RkTD0RHg&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Download the Print &amp;amp; Play: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jCD5Qxb9gmIs8nzKJ78qW0N2tzlpKt2Q&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Find more games by Brother Ming Games here: https://www.brotherminggames.com/&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BrotherMingGames/&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Twitter: https://twitter.com/BrotherMingMing&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

After many prosperous times, the Elements became restless and broke the harmony. They all wanted to conquer the Island with their own elemental power.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Chaotic times begun and one by one, the Mythical beings were forced to leave. The Island was in urgent need of regeneration, so the legendary Protectors were summoned. By using their special powers, the Protectors securely re-arranged the landscape. Their task was to calm the elements and restore the balance, enabling the Mythical beings to return back home.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to maintain continuous stability, the Protectors agreed to reward the most successful Protector as the Guardian of Mythical Island&amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mythical Island is a tile laying game for 2 &amp;ndash; 4 players, age 8 and older. Through out the game, players draw Mythical cards that show a certain landscape pattern.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players&amp;rsquo; aim is to arrange the Landscape tiles so they match the pattern and element shown on the Mythical card. Then players need to move their pawn on this pattern to activate the Mythical card, the points gained will be received at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All Mythical beings in the game are based on Icelandic &amp;amp; Nordic folk tale creatures, a short description can be found in the separate Mythiopedia booklet. The landscape tiles are actual Icelandic locations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game ends when any player activates a certain number of Mythical beings, according to number of players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Some for the favor of the Khan. Some for the own glory. As each bastion is erected, more Exiles wander in from the ruin. We are the lucky. We are the saved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ruination is a 2-4 area control and civilization game set in post-apocalyptic Eurasia. Players take the role of warring hordes, each trying to earn glory for their horde and favor of the Khan. Hordes will gather resources to enlist power mercenaries called Exiles. They will build Endeavors from the wreckage of the world before. They will bolster their armies with units and then march on enemy hordes. The game will end after the 6th bastion is placed on the board. The horde with the most VP will earn the respect of the Khan and thus rule by his side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Being a dragon is usually pretty awesome--wings, firebreath, a big pile o&amp;rsquo;gold to sleep on at night. Until THEY showed up--a &amp;ldquo;party&amp;rdquo; of adventurers who trespassed on your land, in your cavern, to steal YOUR gold. Why? What rights did they have to it? Why is it okay to trample all over yours? Good news, you found the village and castle keep they call home. You&amp;rsquo;re fed up, and you&amp;rsquo;re a dragon, so you&amp;rsquo;re not reasonable. Time to get your gold back and to burn them and their village to the ground.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dragnorak is a scenario-based, fantasy dexterity game where players, acting as dragons, burn hero and villager meeples on a three dimensional board.  During their turn, a player may take a free movement action, then one of four different dexterity attack actions: Firebomb, Spit, Boulder Wheel, and Swoop. Most gold wins, of course, as befits dragons, and don't worry about missed shots--they build up your RAGE, which allows you to keep attacking until hopefully, there is nothing left.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In 1871, the Treaty of Versailles was signed between France and the newly established German Empire, badly shaking the balance of power that had kept Europe relatively stable since Napoleon's defeat in 1815. France longed for revenge against Germany, as did Austria-Hungary, yet the weakening Ottoman Empire seemed a much easier target for recovering the honor she had so recently lost to the ascendant Germans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Meanwhile, Russia longed to see the subject peoples of the Balkans take refuge under her wings, and every attempt by a European power to spread her influence into the Sick Man of Europe was watched with grave concern by all. Russia, with its huge army, was also being closely monitored by Britain in central Asia, where the latter wondered what schemes this eastern giant might have planned. Did Russia have intentions towards Britain's treasure of India? And was this new German Empire friend or foe? Would she attempt the herculean task of building a large navy to rival Britain's? As her chancellor, Bernhard von B&amp;uuml;low, said a quarter century later, &amp;quot;We wish to throw no one into the shade, but we demand our own place in the sun.&amp;quot; This struggle for a place in the sun would ultimately lead to the catastrophe of World War One, drawing all five powers into its maelstrom and destroying three of them in the process.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Our Place in the Sun portrays the rising tensions and dwindling war fuse that burned among the European powers from 1871 until the time of the First World War &amp;mdash; yet a world war is not necessarily your objective. Your goal is simple: Outrank your rivals in national honor with or without the Great War breaking out. To do so, you must spread your influence into the four areas over which the European powers were quarreling during this time: the declining Ottoman Empire, central Asia, the Far East, and Africa. You must also build sizable armies and navies in the event that war does break out. If you are leading in national honor, then this might be the right opportunity for you to initiate the catastrophic conflagration. But if your ambitious schemes isolate you diplomatically, you just might find yourself friendless when war begins and witness the collapse of your empire. Perhaps you should play the honest broker and try to prevent the Great War. Have you the wisdom of a Bismarck, or the incompetence of a Kaiser Wilhelm II?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Our Place in the Sun is a card-driven game inspired by the award-winning two-player game Twilight Struggle, but playable with up to five players. Given the radically different settings of the two games, you will find familiar mechanisms considerably transformed, along with completely new ones, too. Naturally, the events portrayed on the cards are different: the German Fleet Acts, the Boer War, the Boxer Rebellion, the founding of the Indian National Congress, and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand are all here, as well as many, many more. Players can even form alliances and host European Congresses to both lessen tensions and deal with matters they'd very much like to avoid.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Our Place in the Sun can be played in a variety of ways. Given that new players will have no familiarity with the cards, each turn can be played as a one turn mini-game simply to familiarize themselves with the cards available for that turn. (For novices, such a game might take a little more than an hour.) Once players are comfortable with the cards for the first two turns, they may want to try a two-turn game consisting of turns one and two; and when turn three is mastered, a three-turn game, and so on. With experienced players of Our Place in the Sun, a full five-turn campaign game can be anticipated to last from three to three-and-a-half hours. The five-turn game will last much longer for players who don't know the cards! Alternatively, players may play a multi-turn game beginning on a turn other than turn one; two shorter one-region scenarios are available as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The game Hobby Farmer is an attempt to share real-life hobby farm experiences through a board game that everyone can enjoy. The goal is to build a self-sufficient hobby farm, by being the first player to earn the winning number of points by pairing livestock with crops to create sustainable habitats. 2-4 players, ages 6 and up.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, the player rolls the die and moves the number of spaces indicated. Depending on where he/she lands, the player may purchase livestock animals--such as pigs, horses, or chickens--or food habitats (aka, 'crops')--such as apple orchards, pasture, or vegetable gardens. When an animal or crop is purchased, a tile is placed on the player's farmstead in one of the 16 allotted spaces. Depending on how the player places his/her tile, points will be awarded. For example, placing honeybees next to a flower garden will award 2 points. The first player to reach 7, 10, or 14 points (novice, medium, difficult gameplay) wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players earn currency in the game whenever someone lands on the &amp;quot;Farmer's Market&amp;quot; space. Cards are drawn from a special deck indicating which items are in demand at the Farmer's Market. Depending on which animals or crops the player has on his/her farmstead, he/she will be awarded currency accordingly. He/she can then use that currency to purchase more animals or crops to place on their farm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>You are a settler in a new land that is blessed with abundant sugar-producing Maple Trees. Starting with nothing but your sugar shack and a good measure of determination, you must build your sugar mapling enterprise from the ground up. Exploring the forest and tapping the right kinds of trees will generate cash flow that you can use to upgrade your equipment and expand your operation. But beware, other settlers have similar ambitions and will try to beat you to the tap.&amp;#10; To play, each player chooses a cabin site on the gameboard and places their cabin. They also place one tree tap on a tract of land that is adjacent to their cabin. On each turn, the player rolls a die and moves along a track. Depending on where they land, they may be able to purchase supplies or run into danger.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Whenever any player lands on the Sugar Maple tile, all players participate in the syrup harvest as follows: First each player draws one tree card for every tap placed. The tree cards indicate how many gallons of syrup are collected. After all the tree cards are counted, players receive currency (gallons of syrup) that they can use to purchase more land and place more taps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is won by the first player to place all of his/her taps. In a 2-player game, this is 8 taps. In a 3-player game, 7 taps. In a 4-player, 6 taps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Each player gets a board with an animal. When it's his turn, he takes a food tile and tries to fit the tile into his board. The jigsaw puzzle shows whether or not the food Type is a favorite food of the animal. The first person to fill his board with four pieces of food wins. With game variant for older children from 4/5 years.&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fressen Igel Schokoriegel? Aber NEIN!!!

Fressen Wildschweine Beeren? Jeder Spieler bekommt eine Tafel mit einem Tier. Wenn er an der Reihe ist, nimmt er sich ein Futterpl&amp;auml;ttchen und versucht, das Pl&amp;auml;ttchen in seine Tafel zu puzzeln. Die Puzzleausstanzung zeigt, ob das Futter zur Lieblingsspeise des Tieres geh&amp;ouml;rt oder nicht. Wer als Erster seine Tafel mit vier Futterst&amp;uuml;ckchen gef&amp;uuml;llt hat, gewinnt.

						               													<description>Arcane Guardian is a quick, fun solo dungeon crawler card game of tactics, scarce resource management, and luck. Ancient powers have risen and are threatening humanity once more. It is you, the Arcane Mage who must face them. You have to weaken them before they swarm the realm of the living. To do so, you have to confront all the terrors crawling deep below the surface. The goal of the game is simple: escape the dungeon. Will you live to see the daylight?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Arcane Guardian is lightweight and highly enjoyable from the very first play with enough depth to keep you entertained. You control a mage who wanders in an enchanted dungeon, opens treasure chests, fights monsters and drinks magical potions. You have to defeat numerous elementals and undead. Try to save as much Mana as possible, for if you run out of it, you cannot even emit light from your staff and are left in the dark. Your options are limited, while the dangers are many. In Arcane Guardian, every decision matters!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Arcane Guardian is a Print and Play card game. The deck contains 60 cards, and there are an additional 21 cards. One game takes about 10 minutes. The game is made up of steps that are to be carried out in a set order. In the beginning, you have three ways to go. You select a deck and interact with the upper card. If the chosen card was not revealed, then you must reveal it and instantly interact with it. You may collect the card or discard it into the discard pile. After an interaction&amp;rsquo;s end, you have to reveal all cards that are unrevealed (face down) on top of a deck except on the one that you interacted with. If your health goes below 1, and you cannot heal than the game is over and you lose. You should always consider whether to fight an enemy and lose health, or cast spells and spend your mana. You may suffer several terrible curses that weaken you, but you can even their effects out with masks, or create powerful and interesting combinations of different positive and negative magical effects. Of course, luck has an impact on your gameplay, you have to roll a die when you open treasure chests and when you interact with traps.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You play until you find an ending card among the bottom six cards of a deck. If you successfully interact with it, then you win the game and escape the dungeon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Ticket to Ride: London features the familiar gameplay from the Ticket to Ride game series &amp;mdash; collect cards, claim routes, draw tickets &amp;mdash; but on a scaled-down map of 1970s London that allows you to complete a game in no more than 15 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player starts with a supply of 17 double-decker buses, two transportation cards in hand, and one or two destination tickets that show locations in London. On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected. (A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.) You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

This gives the game a more modern look and a strong visual impact, allowing bigger battles in comparison with the previous version of the base game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This base + expansion box includes the following scenarios:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;BRITANNIA:&amp;#10;Fulford, Stamford Bridge, Hastings, Stirling Bridge, Falkirk, Bannockburn (day 1 and 2).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;FRANCE:&amp;#10;Bouvines, Courtrai, Mons-en-Pevele, Crecy, Agincourt, Vernuil&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Meanwhile, gamers looking for a close-matched, fast and exciting experience will find a game that fits both their coffee table and coffee break.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, you&amp;rsquo;ll follow the myriad tribes of Chaos &amp;ndash; reavers and despoilers from every corner of the realms &amp;ndash; as they make their dark pilgrimage to the Varanspire. Warcry explores a never-before-seen side of life (and death!) in the Age of Sigmar. Every model for this game is brand new, reflecting on the dizzying diversity of Chaos on a scale never attempted before and rooted in rich lore that realises the servants of the Dark Gods as deep and varied cultures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Ninja Pizza Party, each player has their own stack of pizza slice cards. Each round, customers equal to one less than the number of players (except in two-player) are randomly chosen and the players all go through their stack of pizza slices one at a time, either adding the slice to their pizza or discarding it. Once they run out of cards in their stack, they take the discard pile from the player to their right to use as their new stack of slices. When a player completes their pizza of six slices, they claim the customer of their choice. This continues until all of the customers have been claimed. Points are awarded based on how many slices each player's pizza has that match the customer's favorite topping.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When building a pizza, the players must match at least one topping on the slice next to the spot where the new slice is going to go. For the sixth (and last) slice, the slice being added needs to match a topping on each of the pieces next to the open slot. Each slice of pizza has two toppings, except for special &amp;quot;kitchen sink&amp;quot; slices, that have all of the available toppings. These special slices are limited to one per pizza. If a player's pizza is completed but does not follow the rules, the player that did not claim a customer can score points for that other player's customer, using their incomplete pizza, provided said pizza DOES follow the placement rules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the round, each player takes their current stack, discard pile, and pizza and combines them to form their new stack for the next round. Customers are randomized and selected again, and the next round begins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This continues until at least one player has 15 points, at which time the player with the most points is declared the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Cordel is one of the most remarkable literary genres of Brazilian literature, and its writers, the &amp;quot;cordelistas&amp;quot;, lead a poetic life, but also very common. In Cordel, you will be a &amp;quot;cordelista&amp;quot;, who builds his life by obtaining and managing inspirations, used to write his &amp;quot;cordels&amp;quot; and take them to the popular fair, marking his captive presence in the line of &amp;quot;cordels&amp;quot;.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the other hand, a &amp;quot;cordelista&amp;quot; is also fundamentally a reader, so you will buy other players' &amp;quot;cordels&amp;quot; for your collection. The best &amp;quot;cordelista&amp;quot; will be the one who can be present with its &amp;quot;cordels&amp;quot; on the clothesline, building patterns of string color sequences, and also obtaining a diverse collection of them. To do this, you must manage your actions well, so you can complete your goals before the others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In their turn, each player has action points, which can be spent writing cordels (spending inspiration), publishing them, buying cordels from other writers, completing goals or collecting new inspirations. Goals are the key to the game, as the victory points guaranteed by it make up the bulk of the final score. Among these objectives, there are 3 categories: the color standards of the cordels on the poles, the presence of players on the poles and the collection of cordels.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The match ends when one of the players reaches a certain number of goals, then the points are scored for the completed goals and other smaller forms of the score. The one who gets the most points at the end will win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Democratic Republic of Korruptonia is in turmoil after the last president was suddenly removed from office (once again). The result of this was a dangerous instability, which swept the influence of the main parties in all regions of Korrupt&amp;ocirc;nia, creating a fertile environment for a non-partisan outlet of the whole country. So to conserve the stewardsh... or rather, the Korruptonian democracy, the country's main political parties articulate an emergency electoral campaign in order to regain partisan prestige and elect a representative.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In order to be able to elect its representative, the party must increase its influence in the regions of the country, through the presence of its candidate or the support of the media, personalities, smaller parties and companies. With the use of mechanics like area control, auction and hand and resource management, Korrupt&amp;ocirc;nia is a strategic game of fantasy themed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are five regions of Korrupt&amp;ocirc;nia, and each one has different demographic characteristics in each game. All these regions begin with a high influence of the partisans and with almost no influence of the great political parties - each party only initiates with a minor influence in its original region. Each player will have five weeks (or five rounds) to reverse this scenario, gaining enough influence for his candidate to lead the polls at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To achieve this, players will have to manage well each of the phases of the rounds: the campaign phase and the political action phase. In each round, the position of the candidates in the polls will determine the order of the players, in descending order.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the campaign stage, players must decide whether to move their candidate and pay the costs (of money and speech, which are two of the three resources that the parties must administer) to campaign wherever they are, gaining influence in doing so .&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After that, in the political actions phase, each player must take one of the actions of the cards in his hand, eventually having to pay his costs (of money, speech and government positions, which are the three features of the game). These actions range from setting up campaign committees, influencing news media for or against candidates, and also hiring famous people for your campaign, joining smaller parties and attracting companies to fund the campaign (these last three actions require a auction with the other parties). After making an action, the player can exchange resources with the political market, which varies with each negotiation, and also use one of the political actions of the open cards on the table, paying extra costs for this. At the end of each round, the party influence in each region determines an update of the voting intentions of the candidates in the polls.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of five weeks, the party ahead in the polls will win the match.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

For this, the vans must cross the track sections, respecting the correct hand of each of them, avoiding being blocked by the others. Managing the van's ability is important: the more crowded, the fewer stretches it can go through in a move. In the end, those who have collected and left a more varied number of passengers will receive a high amount of points, and whoever has more points will win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Likewise, in Alpha Charlie Tango, players have the challenge of uncovering their opponents' secret codes, deciphering each of their parts through a meticulous and strategic choice of which false messages to send, before they discover their code.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are five possible characters, but several combinations, and each time a player sends a three character message, each of the other players signals the presence of these characters in their code (if there are equal characters, only one character must be signaled, which the mission of figuring out your code even harder). In turn, a person may try to deduce a part of the code from another person, but if he makes a mistake, he should reveal a part of his own code. Whoever is the only one still has hidden parts of his own code!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Moscovis are a very friendly family of fly-spiders. However, all Moscovis have some peculiar and hereditary characteristics. The first is that they do not see the colors well, and they reverse the ability to identify each one a little. That would not be a big problem, were it not for another Moscovis trait: a serious food restriction. For Moscovis, eating flakes of certain colors can have serious consequences, from a bellyache to more serious things! That is, a Moscovis can never &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot; away from it's attention!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this way, each player is in the shoes of a member of this family in &amp;quot;The Moscovis&amp;quot;, trying to correctly identify the colors of the flies, in the order in which they are arranged, using the colors they have in mind (or better, in the hands)! The letters have the name of one color, but the color of the letter is different, and each needs to put the names of the colors in order according to the colors of the flies, as soon as possible. The difficulty is heightened by the fact that each set of cards has different combinations of colors and names.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Each player will attempt to kill the opponents Emperor to claim the throne and win the game. This is done by moving their pawns into the opponent's emperor space in the center of the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During each turn, a player will choose a pawn to move to an adjacent open slot. Then they choose to either rotate a ring of the board, place a dragon cylinder to block an opponent or forfeit their secondary action, which removes the rotation tracker from the board. If the player chooses to rotate the ring that their pawn has entered or the center ring, they must mark which direction they rotated the ring by placing the rotation tracker on it. This blocks the next player from undoing the rotation that was just completed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player plans their movements, but find that the grounds beneath them are always shifting, forcing them to plan their movements even more carefully.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Each turn will consist of eating fish to take control of more tiles in on the 7&amp;times;7 grid of fish tiles. Some fish are provided with special abilities that can flip around the progress of tile collecting. At it&amp;rsquo;s core, Gulp is a take that tile game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Gulp will come with 49 tiles featuring level 3 fish like shark all the way to the bottom of the kelp and coral chain. The board is modular as each set up is done by placing the tiles in a 7&amp;times;7 grid and taking turns collecting fish. Each tile can eat a tile below their tier level, and any empty spaces left leave fish unable to move. Each fish can move horizontally or vertically.  Whichever fish is on the top of a stack is the winner of the pile at the end of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>You and your team have just returned from an incredible adventure on the mysterious planet Zont, but there's just one problem &amp;ndash; you don't remember any of it! Zont! is a co-op storytelling game of adventure that fosters creative thinking and teamwork.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To begin, each player chooses a role (Captain, Scientist, Explorer, Security, Diplomat or Engineer). Memory tiles that depict a color (Emotion) and a word are turned over and spread out in the center of the table. A Story Plot is chosen at random, this is the goal the team was trying to accomplish on their mission and indicates a specific word found on the Memory tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn a Player reveals two Memory tiles. If two matching colors are found that Player begins a &amp;quot;Complete Memory&amp;quot; using the Emotion indicated by the color and the two different words on the tiles. Each other player then contributes by &amp;quot;Adding To&amp;quot; the memory from the viewpoint of their role on the team. After all players have had a chance to &amp;quot;Add To&amp;quot; the memory, the pair of tiles are placed on the Memory Track at a point determined by the team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After 8 Complete Memories (linked from Start of Story to End of Story) are found you will have pieced together your trip to Zont and have a unique story only your team could have had.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Winning or Losing is optional. To Win the players must find and work the Story Plot term into the story and individual players are awarded points on their participation. But for younger or more casual play the journey itself is just as rewarding.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We hope you had a wonderful time on Zont!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>10 years world economic crisis - reason enough to project the thing as a caricature on your table. In Der gro&amp;szlig;e Reibach, every player turns into the CEO of a big bank, trying to cash in as much money as their questionable means allow. The goal of the game is to be the first have 80 TSD in the bank.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The basic trade for these banks is customer business. Each bank has three branches where they can look after different customers and try to cash in on their investments.&amp;nbsp;You earn your costumers&amp;rsquo; trust through persuasive bank advisors. If the trust is established you will fill your pockets with quick cash, but as soon as the trust is lost the costumers will flee and the money with them.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To make sure the other banks won&amp;rsquo;t do too well, there are plenty of action cards you can use to influence and manipulate the competition. Lawyers, for example, sue the most capable employees of the other banks, the black bloc destroys entire branches, and the critical shareholder worries the investors of your competitors. On the other hand, of course, one's own bank can also be improved by incidentally food speculation, attracting rating agencies or allowing brokers to work for you. With over 50 different cards and a total card number of 185 cards there are numerous options available to pave the path to the big money.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The own pocket is represented in the game by a small cloth bag, so that the competition cannot see your fortune and nobody can be certain to win the game until the very end. Suspense until the big finale is guaranteed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The turn-based game is characterized by having a very high level of interaction between the players and which allows to have a great impact on the moves and opportunities of other players. With a duration of 90 to 180 minutes (depending on the number of players), there are enough opportunities to make up for any financial arrears. Each turn you hold, six action points can be used. You can split them up between buying new cards, playing the cards in your hand, and activating cards already placed. You control the markets and gameplay through your own behavior, so that no match is the same and different tactics can be profitable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Play as an Exiled Legend, a powerful deity that rules over the desolate land to which they have been banished. Build your team of Heroes and fight to gain control in the Banesphere. Will you emerge victorious or suffer a bitter defeat?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fighters gather at the gates of the Banesphere waiting to be selected for battle. As a Legend, you start by choosing six fighters to serve as  your Heroes and to enter the Banesphere to test your team's prowess. Your team will have one Champion and two Supports at a time, fighting on your behalf. Each time your Champion is defeated, you will promote one of your Supports and bring in a new fighter to take the vacant Support position.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you run out of fighters, you must enter the fray yourself. But be warned: if you are defeated, your entire team must immediately retreat from combat and return to the barren wasteland until the next battle.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn, players will manage Bane tokens, activate Hero abilities and attack their opponents' Heroes in order to ultimately destroy their champions and force the Legend into the fray. A Legend emerges victorious when they force their each of their opponents to flee back to the barrens.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Defcon Dice is a strategic dice and card game where players take turns either manipulating dice on the battlefield or claiming them using one of their available cards.

						               													<description>Art Major is a competitive card game based around matching the paint cards in your hand with the required paint cards for your next masterpiece.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Acquiring paint is a slow process, trickling in at a rate of one paint a turn. You need to either trade for the paint you need &amp;hellip; or sell one of your masterpieces. Each painting can be sold for paint, rather than kept for victory points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally, the more paintings you can get in a gallery, the more prestige you receive. The first player to collect ten points is recognized as the master painter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Art Major has a nice blend of strategy, bluffing, and trading. Players are encouraged to trade anything they want, and with only two simple moves, the game can really begin moving at a quick pace.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;One interesting piece of Art Major is that paint only comes in primary colors (Red, Blue, Yellow), but most paintings require secondary colors (Orange, Green, Purple) to be complete. This means players must &amp;ldquo;mix&amp;rdquo; paints, and use extra cards to paint their masterpiece.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>1824 Austria-Hungary is a railway building and share dealing game for 3-6 players. It is based on Francis Tresham's game 1829 and on Leonhard Orgler's game 1837.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player who has the greatest wealth in cash and shares at the end of the game is the winner. A set of simple mechanisms form the basis of 1824 Austria-Hungary.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You use the yellow, green, brown and gray tiles to create a rail network on the map. Just as in a real railway business, the track in the game connects railway stations to each other. The trains (train cards) make notional journeys from one station to the next and thereby earn money. The (imaginary) passengers pay for their journeys. The more numerous and the more important the stations on a train's journey are, the more money it earns for the company and its shareholders.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game you and your fellow players can own up to 6 Mountain Railways, 4 Coal Railways, 7 forerunners of the National Railways, as well as shares in 3 National Railways and 5 Regional Railways. The Major Companies (the National and Regional Railways) belong to their shareholders. The player with the most shares in the company is the Director of that company and decides how the company will act.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game is a further streamlined version of the self-published 1824 from 2005.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

SWUP makes you use your brain to calculate the best possible way of using the cards you are dealt. Block your opponents by building with the right cards and if you remove the last card on the table you get a SWUP. A great math game where you must calculate and stay sharp to win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;SWUP is based on Casino, but with added/changed elements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each player is dealt four cards, and four cards are dealt to the table (only first round). Then players either take a trick, by adding cards on the table to become the same value as the card they play, build new cards by adding their card to a card already on the table, or play their cards on the table. Doubles and triples can also be built (and they can't be changed). Once all players have played their four cards, each player is deal four new cards. Play continues until all cards are dealt and played.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Points are scored the follwoing in a players trick pile:&amp;#10;Most cards: 1 point&amp;#10;Most black cards: 2 points&amp;#10;Last trick: 1 point&amp;#10;Each star: 1 point&amp;#10;Each SWUP (clearing the table): 1 point&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Dopeman is a not-so-family-friendly board game. Play as a power-hungry drug dealer trying to get rich quick. Deliver goods to your customers but watch out for the cops and rival dealers. They&amp;rsquo;ll try to take you down as you negotiate, bribe, and scheme your way to the top. Make the most money before time&amp;rsquo;s up, and you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The board is your block. To move forward, you&amp;rsquo;ll move your game piece around the sidewalk clockwise. You&amp;rsquo;ll also find a road that the cops drive on, a jail in the middle of the board, and apartments where you will deliver drugs. Your game piece moves based on the white die and the Cop Car moves based on the black die. The person who most recently did drugs goes first.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are four drugs in the game: Weed, Molly, Coke, and Shrooms. Before the game begins, you&amp;rsquo;ll select one type of drug. There are four Suppliers on the board &amp;mdash; one for each type of drug. Suppliers sell you drugs, which you&amp;rsquo;ll then sell at a higher price to your Clients for a profit. Each player has one Supplier from which they buy their designated drug exclusively. You can buy baggies of your designated drug for $10 each from your Supplier every time you land on, or pass over, your Supplier&amp;rsquo;s tile. You may buy as much as you can afford.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You&amp;rsquo;ll receive a Text Message card every time you land on or pass over, a notification tile. There are two types - those from Clients who would like to buy drugs (this will include which drugs they want, how many baggies, and which apartment to deliver them to), and those from Informants who give you advantages throughout the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To sell drugs:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Pass over, or land on, your Client&amp;rsquo;s apartment (indicated by their Text Message).&amp;#10;     Burn Text Message card.&amp;#10;     Discard sold drugs to the box.&amp;#10;     Pick up $50 per drug sold from the box.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a Cop Car that travels around the board trying to bust dealers. If at any point, you have possession of drugs and the Cop Car lands on the adjacent tile to your game piece, you&amp;rsquo;ll go to Jail. (You will only be arrested if you&amp;rsquo;re in possession of drugs.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are two ways to avoid being arrested:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Bribe the Cops with $50. (The money should be put back into the box.)&amp;#10;     Blackmail the cops with an appropriate Text Message from an Informant.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you go to Jail, you must discard all of your drugs and weapons. To get out, you must complete a loop around the Jail with your game piece.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If on your turn, you land on a tile shared by another dealer&amp;rsquo;s game piece, you have the option to rob your friend, potentially stealing their drugs. Both players roll one die (the number you roll represents your Attack Strength), and the highest Attack Strength wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On your turn, you may buy weapons - Brass Knuckles, a Switchblade, and/or a Pistol. Weapons increase your Attack Strength during a robbery. You can continue to use your weapons until they&amp;rsquo;re confiscated by the police.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You can also buy an Associate. Associates follow you around the board, allowing you to increase your attack strength during a robbery and increase your movement around the board by +1.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their respective turns, players may trade Text Messages, drugs, weapons, or cash. There are no rules around trading &amp;mdash; all is fair in love and drugs. If, at any point, you run out of cash, you&amp;rsquo;re out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When time is up, each player is given one last turn, starting with the first player of the game. When the last player completes their turn, each dealer should count how much cash they have. If you have a weapon, or unsold drug baggies, you may liquidate them for the price you paid. Once each player has tallied their liquidated assets and cash, the player with the highest total wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>December 8, 1941. One hour and 20 minutes prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Imperial Army's open battle code &amp;quot;Hinode wa yamagata&amp;quot; was issued. As a result, the landing operation to the northern part of the Malay Peninsula was started, and the three-year and nine-month-old Pacific War fire pit was cut and dropped. A new battle vessel Prince of Wales overwhelming the ocean. Flying Fortress B-17s covering the heavens. MacArthur swears revenge. And the three great fortresses of Singapore, Hong Kong, and Corregidor stand in front of the Japanese army. Will you be able to lead the south operation to success in a hundred days after the opening?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

He has to split them: a group of 2 cards and a single card aside. The other player now chooses which group of card(s) he claims for himself. The dealer receives the remaining card / group of 2 cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Cards are of 3 main types:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Cabins cards allow to &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; one or several cabins in your boat (there are 3 levels of cabins), now ready for a passenger to get in. &amp;#10;     Passenger cards have to be immediately affected to a previously open cabin. Each placed passenger gives a certain number of victory points (occasionally negative) or a specific symbol, but also expects a certain level of cabin: additional negative/positive bonuses are granted depending on how this requirement is fulfilled.&amp;#10;     Objective cards give final points according to various criteria.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each 5 rounds, one of the 4 &amp;quot;stopover&amp;quot; cards of the game is revealed and resolved. The player who has the most of a certain element (passengers, open cabins, happy faces...) gets 6 points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Final scoring comes with a few additional evaluations: collected objectives, symbol collection...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
