						               													<description>The end of the Aesir has come, but not as the prophecies foretold. The dread dragon Niddhoggr has devoured the roots of the World Ash, Yggdrasil, and the great tree has toppled onto its side, crashing the realms of mortal and supernatural together. With the gods dead and the fires of ruin consuming the world, your war clan of Viking warriors know what they must do to survive the destruction of the Nine Realms and restore order: they must become the new gods!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ragnarok is a campaign-driven skirmish game in which players form a Viking war clan seeking to prove itself worthy of becoming the new pantheon. The use of a mechanic called Godspark means that battles are no longer determined by merely striking an opponent and dealing damage. Instead, warriors will be pushing, throwing, and crashing their opponents around the battlefield, making their very environment a weapon. As the war clans develop, they may gain glorious new powers that will bring them closer to godhood, or win the respect of the denizens of the realms, allowing them to bring dire wolves, dwarves, and even the dreaded giants into their war clans. With strategic gameplay and epic storytelling, players must write their own sagas and tell of how their war clans have, through blood and steel, clawed their way up from ruin to stand before the halls of Valhalla.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Arena Colossei is a miniature game by OrcoNero Games, set in ancient Rome. Choose your favourite combat technique and make your gladiator fight! The game can rely on three great features: amazing miniatures, an original and extremely competitive gameplay, historical accuracy at its highest level for what concerns this specific topic.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is divided into rounds. To begin with, each player must select which cards (minimum 1) he will play during the current round. Each card represents specific moves and maneuvers the gladiators can perform. The original FightHex system integrate all the information about direction, armor and line of vision directly on the miniatures' bases!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The round begins: the players must choose, alternatively, which move their gladiators will perform, trying to predict and counter the opponent's movements at their best. At the end of each round all the cards will be refreshed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As soon as two miniatures are in contact the fight beings! Use the tiles to defend or attack a specific zone of the gladiator: block the enemy's attacks and penetrate his guard. In this phase, predicting where your opponent is going to hit and where he will parry is essential! If your opponent's defense tile does not match your attack tile... your attack is a success, pull out a damage token from the bag!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On the Favour of the Public track, there is a token called Summa Rudis. Both if you penetrate the enemy's guard or block his attacks, move the token towards your side. Either if the token Summa Rudis reach the last position on your side of the track, or at the end of the 15th round the Summa Rudis is on your side of the track, you win!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game can be played in two modalities: Duel (1 Vs 1) and Melee (2 Vs 2). Moreover, each type of gladiator has three levels of experience with special moves and techniques!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Hindsight: 2020 is a real-time cooperative dice-drafting puzzle game for 1 to 4 players. On your turn, you will select two dice of the same color from a grid of 36--the first, the ACTION DIE, determines your main action by its position and your bonus action by its value; the second die, the POWER DIE, determines the strength of first action. You will use the actions to manipulate the puzzle tiles, to alter the dice in the grid (for future turns), and to manage the timer. The adjustable difficulty level will keep you on your toes for play after play as your team gets better at solving the puzzle quickly. Thinky and frantic, saving the world has never been so fun.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Theme:&amp;#10;The apocalypse is upon us! If only we&amp;rsquo;d seen it coming. Luckily for the rest of humanity, you&amp;rsquo;ve just finished the prototype for your new time-intervention device. Alas, it&amp;rsquo;s a little unstable and unreliable--it is a prototype, after all. You&amp;rsquo;ve figured out what intervention is needed to stop the apocalypse, but it takes some tinkering to get the machine aligned so your operatives can make those changes. You have just a couple minutes to find the right configuration of your machine to send back our intervention agents and save the world. Can you finish before the apocalypse arrives? Time to find out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Saving the world, as fast as you can. The game has two play areas, a 6 by 6 dice grid, and a tile tableau. The dice grid has twelve actions you may take, one for each row and one for each column. At the top of the tile area are six &amp;ldquo;keystone&amp;rdquo; tiles numbered 1-6, representing the code you need to match. In an array of 36 tiles below the keystone line are columns of similar tiles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When you select your Action die, you place it at the end of either the row or the column, indicating which action you intend to take. Then you select your Power die, another die of the same color, and place it on the Power die space outside the grid. The action you selected is augmented by the Power die, and allows you to manipulate the tile tableau or the dice grid. After you take your main action, you get a secondary action determined by the value of the action die you took. These secondary actions allow you to flip the sand timer and add more dice to the grid, among other things.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To solve the puzzle, you need to manipulate the tiles so that the top of each column matches the keystone number above it. When the number matches, you can &amp;ldquo;lock&amp;rdquo; that combination in place, triggering the bonus (or penalty) card attached to that column. You win if you are able to lock all six columns before you run out of dice or timer flips. Of course, if you ever let the timer run out, you also lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is how the world ends:&amp;#10;Accompanying Hindsight: 2020 is a thematic website that uses your six-digit keystone code to reveal what happened to cause the apocalypse, and how your team did or did not succeed in preventing the end of the world.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A powerful warrior-mage, you have pledged yourself to an ancestral cast of elite guardians sworn to to protect the sanctuaries of the Seven Vales. When your home is attacked, you take it upon yourself to go beyond your calling, and take the road in search of lost and stolen magical artifacts vital for the safeguard of your world. Do you and your allies have what it takes to become the first Soul Raiders the Seven Vales has known in centuries?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Soul Raiders is an original saga, the first crafted specifically for the Running Quest game system. This immersive narrative experience, in a high-fantasy world setting, pits epic heroes against diabolical villains in a race to recover powerful relics that were used to build the foundations of their universe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each game box, or Tome, is divided into several game sessions,or Chapters, forming and epic series of adventures that will evolve dramatically thanks to the heroic actions of  players and the missions you accomplish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Running Quest game system employs clever cooperative mechanics for 1-4 players, confronting heroes with a new threat in every chapter. During your turn, you act independently or in collaboration to explore surroundings, defeat adversaries and complete missions. The setting is composed of various locations, depicted on numbered cards that you will uncover as you progress through your adventures.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You draw your actions from a personal deck of cards, managing your hand carefully to choose your path : will you spend all your Action points to climb sneakily over the drawbridge, or should you spend a little less to lower it down in a more direct approach?  You could also look for an entrance hidden in the surrounding swamps... Each choice has a different consequence, but there is no ideal itinerary to follow in order to win the game, as the author made sure that any path is a victorious possibility, even if some are easier than others.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A truly cooperative experience, adventurers share a common pool of life points, increasing the global threat level as you take more and more wounds. You will triumph if you accomplish the various quests hidden in the many locations of the chapter, but lose if you run out of time or allow your opponents to overwhelm you. The enemies' behavior being dictated by the combination of locations in play, you will have to choose wisely when to fight, or when to... run!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game box holds over one thousand illustrated cards of various sizes, miniatures for the adventurers, and a number of tokens and tracks. Storing components are provided to save your characters' equipment and skills from one chapter to another, and even from one Tome to another!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

First everyone works on building their doujinshi, working to get one each of Title, Cover, Element, and Genre cards. If you have two of the same card, you can turn one to the dark side (usually worth negative points) and force it on to an opponent. After one person has one of each card on the Light Side you move on to the Event Phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the Event Phase, it's finally the big day of the convention and everyone tries to sell their doujinshi. While base points are decided in the first phase, in the Event phase a variety of surprises can change everything around.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Satirical card game Antyszczepionkowcy.biz (anti-vaccers.biz) is designed to trick players to becoming aware of the value of vaccinations. &amp;#10;Players can expect perverse humour and fun with friends. The game shows the consequences and realities of the activities of businessmen profiting from alternative medicine.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players try to gain influence at all costs by selling useless goods in their online stores. They also collect signatures and lobby for harmful laws. Their actions affect the population resistance index, and over time, cases of various diseases become more dangerous. This may harm the anti-vaccers themselves ... unless they are smart enough to vaccinate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them on the table. If the player draws a disease with the same name as a disease already on the table, he was too greedy and his turn ends immediately. All the cards were drawn in this turn being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then earn as much money as much card he draws and buys one card (Product / Signature for Law / Action). Of course, players can vaccinate themselves: this hypocrisy costs them -1 point per vaccinate but give them a possibility to ignore the first card of a disease per turn.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When one player has at least ten influence points the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The world's first dodgeball card game. Collect cards. Play your hand. Throw things at your friends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Throw Throw Burrito is what you get when you cross a card game with dodgeball. Try to collect matching sets of cards faster than your opponents while simultaneously ducking, dodging, and throwing squishy airborne burritos. The cards you collect earn points, but getting hit by flying burritos loses them. So clear some space and put away the antiques, because you&amp;rsquo;ve never played a card game quite like this before.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;How it works: Place a pair of burritos on a table and draw cards. Keep your cards a secret. Rack up points by finding sets of three in the deck. Find matches before anyone else does. If someone plays Burrito Cards, a Battle ensues. Steal points from your opponents by hitting them with squishy toy burritos. Declare war on your friends. Some battles only involve a handful of players. Others force the entire table to engage in a Burrito War. Duel to determine the winner. During a Burrito Duel, two players must stand back to back, walk three paces, and FIRE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Kiwi Scrabble is just like the classic brain-teasing word game, but features a twist designed especially for the Kiwis. Using the slang one can only learn by being a proud New Zealander. Just like classic Scrabble, players earn points by forming interlocking words, cross-word fashion, using letter tiles with various score values. In a fun twist, the specially designed Kiwi Scrabble game board features &amp;quot;YEAH NAH&amp;quot; spaces -- if a player forms a word crossing one or more of these, they'll get to draw a &amp;quot;YEAH NAH&amp;quot; card that offers an advantage over their opponents. Also included is a Kiwi Word List, displaying heaps of Kiwi-specific slang and definitions to help you get creative with your word play. Play any word on this list to earn extra points that could help you win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Includes game board, 100 letter tiles, 36 cards, 4 racks, cotton tile pouch (Which is Black only for the Kiwis), word list and rule book.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Encyclopaedist (&amp;#231;&amp;#153;&amp;#190;&amp;#231;&amp;#167;&amp;#145;&amp;#229;&amp;#175;&amp;#169;&amp;#232;&amp;#173;&amp;#176;&amp;#229;&amp;#174;&amp;#152;) is a three-player only game in which you're trying to give eight correct answers or place a correct answer in each of seven categories. What are those categories, and how is an answer correct? Read on...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To set up the game, lay out the yellow, green, and red loops so that they overlap like a Venn diagram and form seven specific regions: yellow-only, yellow-and-green, all three colors, etc. Each player represents one of these colors. Each player chooses a category in secret, with the category being something that can easily divide answers into &amp;quot;belongs&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;does not belong&amp;quot;. Examples might be things with four legs, foods, games by Reiner Knizia, things you can cut, and school subjects. Each player writes something that belongs in their category, then the other two players move those answers to the proper region. (If you're yellow, for example, you must give an answer that belongs in the yellow category, but that answer might also belong in the red or green category as well.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Following this set-up, on a turn one player places a token in one of the seven regions, e.g., inside the red and green categories but outside the yellow one. Each player now gives an answer that matches the status of their own category, then the other players say whether or not your answer is placed in their categories or not. If your answer fits within the proper region, then you score a point and leave the colored portion of your answer sheet visible; if it's not in the proper region, then you hide the colored portion (to show that you don't score), but leave the answer visible to give information to other players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to score 1 point in all seven regions or to score 8 points total wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In the XII century, during the territory reconquest, small kingdoms are formed in the Iberian Peninsula, which will continue to fight among themselves in the following centuries. In the West, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, a new country is born &amp;ndash; Portugal. The first Portuguese kings strongly invest their efforts and scarce resources in the expansion of the territory towards South, while organizing the defense of these new borders. Castles are built and land-use contracts are given to small villages that grow bigger and gain more importance in these parts of the country.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Where today exists in the County of Idanha-a-Nova a line with six castles which was formed to help in the defence of the Country and maintain distance from the kingdom of Leon. This line of Castles enabled the growth of a region that since the time of the Roman presence had an enormous importance in the interior of the peninsula.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In 6 Castelos, 1 to 4 players are representatives of the king seeking to promote agriculture, free trade, religious faith and wealth for the nobles of the kingdom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>We are all Fools on our journeys through this world. It&amp;rsquo;s dangerous to go alone. Take this game with you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Fellowship of Fools: The (Friendship) Game (or FoF) is based on the Tarot, in use since the 14th century for games and since the 17th century for divination. The art for Fellowship of Fools dates back to 1761 to its creation in France by Nicolas Conver de Marseilles and is called the Tarot de Marseilles. Today, Tarot cards are widely used  for game playing, creativity, divination and personal development. Our hope is that FoF can turn that inward reflection of the Tarot outward to help players develop friendships.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We&amp;rsquo;ve split the Tarot deck into its two parts&amp;mdash;-the Major Arcana for Situations and the Minor Arcana for Topics. On each card are two different prompts&amp;mdash;-corresponding to the upright and the reversed meaning of the card. Numbers next to the prompts indicate their difficulty, possible points that can be gained or lost for playing that prompt, as well as the number of Topic Prompts that can be played for that Situation Prompt.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are multiple ways to play Fellowship of Fools: The (Friendship) Game: solo, with two players, or with multiple players. We encourage players to experiment with the cards and find their own ways to play. Visit to our Gamplay page to see the many ways to play, then experiment with the game and submit your own ways to play!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In this game you play as a &amp;quot;pooplord&amp;quot; of a preselected kingdom. Your goal is to grow up your animals from &amp;quot;Puppy&amp;quot; stage to &amp;quot;Wise&amp;quot; stage. How? You have 3 types of cards: Animals, Kingdoms and Extras. Animals are your creatures, your babies, you take care of them. Each animal belongs to a kingdom. There are 6 Kingdom cards: Alpacas, Flamingos, Pandas, Unicorns, Sloths and Dinosaurs. Your goal is to own 3 animals of your kingdom on your field, complete of their &amp;quot;poop markers&amp;quot; aka being Wise. Extra cards can help you doing that! EXTRAS are 2 different types: TRICKS (can be used unlimitedly and in any moment) and TREATS (can be played max 2 per turn unless specified otherwise). Each turn has different phases. The first thing you want to do is to position &amp;quot;poop markers&amp;quot; on your animals card (does not apply in the first player's first turn). You get 1 poop marker per animal. Then you draw 2 cards, choosing between the 2 decks (animals deck, extras deck), the combination is up to you (1/1, 2/0, 0/2). You can play a maximum of 2 cards per turn, if there aren't cards in your field allowing you to play more. Playing cards, the player should try to prevent opponents to stack poop markers on animals while trying to fully stack his own animals. The winner is the first player owning 3 wise animals on his field. During the &amp;quot;stacking poop&amp;quot; phase, poop markers can't be prevented, so be sure to clean up the poop you want to delete before the next player's turn's begin (before your ending phase, to be clear). All this stuff fits into funny artworks and weird characters!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Deranged is a gothic semi-cooperative adventure survival game in which you fight rivals, horrific monsters, and your own inner demons.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In more detail, you must survive in a city for three days and nights, leaving this city uncursed as a human being in order to win. The game is scenario-driven, and you never know when a player &amp;mdash; or which player &amp;mdash; will turn into a monster (the deranged of the title). The only way to turn back into a human is to kill another player. There is no player elimination, but each death increases the level of doom, with the player receiving a curse or with other bad stuff possibly happening to the group as a whole. You might have better odds of surviving Deranged if you form temporary alliances, but good luck keeping those in place when you might have to kill one another...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Deranged includes deck-building elements, and each player has their own hidden objective. The game board is modular, and the game includes miniatures to represent the players, both as humans and as members of the deranged.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>A terrible drought has struck a bountiful jungle and all the animals are left with no food to eat. Jungle wardens' airplanes are parachuting food packages to the animals, but each animal prefers its own kind of food! To complicate the matters further, all packages look the same and animals first need to open them to see what's inside. All the animals rush wildly for the clearings where food packages appear...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The object of Jungle Chase is to collect as many food packages as possible before they run out. Players do so by controlling six animals each of varying strength on a hexagonal board representing a jungle with clearings and landing spots for food packages. On their turn, players roll two six-sided dice to determine which animals may move one space each, with doubles enabling special moves. When animals of opposing players meet the stronger animal chases its opponent off the board.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Contents of food packages are hidden from players and a player whose animal enters the package space may look at it without revealing the contents to other players. If the food is appropriate for the animal, the player may now collect it. When all packages, whose number is determined at the beginning of the game, have been collected the player with the most food is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Jungle Chase is a &amp;quot;classical&amp;quot; board game with game pieces, dice and a board with a very deliberate old-school feel and yet quite modern in it's final execution in terms of tempo, duration etc. Basic mechanics and inherent logic are quite simple and yet the game strives to offer enough depth for an adult to enjoy the game as well.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Every day, semi trucks haul loads across the country on short and long hauls. How these loads get to their destinations takes planning and a knowledge of the highways of our country.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Choose a handle, take the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat of a semi truck, and test your skills against other truckers as you cross the country in an effort to rise to the top of the trucking industry. Haulin&amp;rsquo; is an immersive game that will put you in the drivers seat of your very own semi truck. Traveling through an often changing world of natural disasters and dreaded road construction, as a semi driver, your job is to choose which loads you want to pick up and deliver to cities in need. Choose to deliver dedicated loads which only you have been hired to haul or race against fellow truckers to be the first to deliver nationwide dispatch loads. Be warned, trucking is a competitive business. As you race to haul more loads than anyone else, keep an eye on the other truckers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The trucker who delivers all of their dedicated loads first, ends the game. However, the trucker who delivers the most loads to cities in need will win the game, so plan well and get Haulin&amp;rsquo;!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The game will start with 1 to 7 and the Joker with just 8 cards. &amp;#10;The rules are simple. The one who issued the biggest number card among the four people is the winner of that round! However, if there are other people who gave the same numbers to the battlefield, even if they are issuing the largest numbers, they will fail immediately. The person who submitted the next big card becomes the winner of the round. &amp;#10;In the total of the pair, it is the final winner to control the 4 rounds first. Which pair pairs the opponent's strong cards while crushing the game, checking the game and winning first?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This work is packaged with the same design as the game appearing in Movie Bet Kegelui which is supervised by Oink Games ! It has become a product that you can take home the excitement in the movie and play it as it is! &amp;#10;(Since the game rules are supposed to use a special system in the play, it has been slightly changed in the packaged version)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In battle, there are no equals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Battle of Legends, Volume One features four heroes. King Arthur sacrifices cards to power up his attacks and gets some timely assistance from Merlin's magic. Alice is back from Wonderland with a giant vorpal blade and the Jabberwock by her side as she grows and shrinks to gain advantages on attack and defense. Medusa is happy to attack from range and let her harpies hound you, but just one devastating glance could end the battle quickly. Sinbad grows in power as he gains experience on each of his voyages.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh&amp;auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In battle, there are no equals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. (Note that this set is solely for two players, but it can be combined with other sets, which all serve up to four players.) Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Robin Hood vs. Bigfoot features the titular heroes. Robin Hood and his outlaws excel at ranged attacks and robbing from their opponents. Bigfoot and his pal, the Jackalope, crash through the forest for quick attacks before disappearing like a figment of the mind.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhauser for ranged attacks and area effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In this new Jungle Speed version for kids, be the first to catch the totem when two identical tiles appear. The goal of the game is to collect the most tiles by game's end.  This version differs from standard Jungle Speed by mixing in elements from the classic children's game Memory which makes it perfect for younger children to enter the world of Jungle Speed.  The game consists of 36 animal tiles and the Jungle Speed totem.  The tiles are comprised of 8 each of a monkey, elephant, giraffe, and zebra along with 4 lions.  All the tiles are placed face-down in a grid just like &amp;quot;Memory&amp;quot; with the totem placed at the center of the grid.  Each player takes turns flipping over one tile in the grid making sure each player has seen it and then replacing it face-down in its original place.  As soon as a flipped tile matches one that has previously been flipped (not including the lions), the players race to grab the totem.  The player who is fastest to the totem now has to turn over the correct matching tile hopefully remembering where it is.  If they are successful they collect both tiles and put it in a pile in front of them.  If they do not flip over the correct tile, they are frozen and can not grab for the totem until they use their next turn to become unfrozen.  When a player flips over a lion tile , the tile is removed from the grid and placed on the side of the grid.  When the fourth lion tile is flipped, the game immediately ends and the player with the most tiles wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Maybe dive into someone else&amp;rsquo;s hand with a Threesome, or if someone is trying to dish out Whore Points to you, Cockblock them. Still, sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s just nothing left to do but resort to Because Fuck You, That&amp;rsquo;s Why! This game has a deck just for that too.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you love the hilarious inappropriateness of Cards Against Humanity, but also like a more structured, social game as well, Your Mother Is A Whore will deliver tons of laughs along with its fun, highly interactive 'take that' gameplay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Apocalypse Europe: WWII is a grand strategy wargame set around World War 2 in Europe. The game starts in January 1936 and can play as far as December of 1946. It is a 2-3 player game and takes about 4 hours to play, suitable for ages 12+. The game board is a map of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East as it was at the time which the players will be vying for control over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is a three-sided game between three Factions; the Western Allies, the Soviet Union and the Axis. The players will take control of the Factions and their countries, trying to defeat each other by conquering or defending territory. Players will be responsible for managing resources, politics and warfare on land, sea and in the air. But this depth has been crafted using simple systems in only 13 pages of rules which allow the game to flow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Units represent army-level formations, entire air forces and fleets, as such the focus is on the big picture. Meaningful choices and consequences are a constant. How will the players choose their priorities? Do they increase their economic power at the cost of their political strength? Do they improve their stability or bring minor countries into their Faction? How should they build their armed forces? All of this will shape how the second world war unfolds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Welcome to the Boogie Beasts skydive meet-up! If this is your first boogie, don&amp;rsquo;t worry: a boogie simply is a skydiving party and we&amp;rsquo;re here to have fun. Let your inner animal come out and take the plunge!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has four rounds, also known as jumpruns. In each jumprun you will receive cards that will allow you to plan your jump. You can jump alone or in formations. But be careful! Your jump only lasts one minute, and each formation requires a set number of jumpers! Only successful jumps and formations will score you points with the jury.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Boogie Beasts is a card game under time pressure, where bluffing and lying is expressly allowed. Teaming up with other jumpers increases your potential score, but also risks failing the jump all together. Get the best combined score out of the four jumpruns, and you'll be the Boogie Beasts champion!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Find your way to Together.....&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A Valentime's themed card game for 2 player. All player roles are non-gender specific.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Needed to play:&amp;#10;5 cards, 9 cubes and 1d6 inside a d6&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game, both players are playing cooperatively. Your goal is to move your player markers from their starting spaces to the &amp;lsquo;Together&amp;rsquo; spaces, at the end of the game board, during your shared turn. If you cannot do this before the marker on the board&amp;rsquo;s time track reaches 0, or, if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Setup&amp;#10;Place the two halves of the game board so that the sides marked A face each other. Place the 2 player markers on their respective               starting spaces at the end of the board. Place each of the 4 Hobgoblins of Sadness markers on the 4 black squares. Place 1 on the board&amp;rsquo;s time track. Lastly, each player should choose one side of a personality card and place a marker, in their &amp;#10;matching color, on the [8] space of their energy track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players play:&amp;#10;One player rolls the die in a die. Each player then chooses one of die roll results to apply to either movement or energy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For each 6 rolled, move the marker on the time track down 1 number. Remember: if the marker on time track on reaches 0, you have both lost the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Movement is either left or right, forward or back, never diagonally (unless a special action allows this).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At any time during their shared turn, each player may use the special action listed on their card. Reduce the energy on your card&amp;rsquo;s track to pay for this, as specified by the special action. Your energy levels may never go above 8 or below 0. Remember: if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you have both lost the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players may move to a space occupied by a Hobgoblin. If, at any time, a player&amp;rsquo;s marker is on the same space as a Hobgoblin, they may spend 2 energy to send the Hobgoblin back to a starting space of their choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Hobgoblins of Sadness play:&amp;#10;All Hobgoblins of Sadness now move 2 spaces - left, right, forward or back, never diagonally. Players will always move the Hobgoblins towards the player marker nearest to a Hobgoblin&amp;rsquo;s position. If both player markers are equally distant, move the Hobgoblin to the player with the most energy. If still tied, move them towards the player of your choice.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a Hobgoblin moves to a player&amp;rsquo;s space they will reduce that player&amp;rsquo;s energy by 1 or 2.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Next Turns and Game End: &amp;#10;Players now move or gain energy on their shared turn, followed by the Hobgoblins movement. If both players enter their final &amp;lsquo;Together&amp;rsquo; spaces at the same time, during their shared turn, they win the game and have found their way to Together.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you cannot do this before the marker on the board&amp;rsquo;s time track reaches 0, or, if either of you has 0 energy at the end of your shared player turn, you lose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A new game in the &amp;quot;Gameshop&amp;quot; series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Blood of Empires a game of a grand strategy set in the ancient Mediterranean region, starting in 264 BC. It is for 2-4 players and takes about 2 hours to play. It has simple rules allowing for ease of play while also having deep strategy providing a compelling challenge with constantly meaningful choices for the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC his empire has fragmented into different successor factions, with the two predominant ones being the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt. Meanwhile Rome has been solidifying its hold of the Italian peninsula growing into a major regional power and the Carthaginians have become the dominant trade and naval power of the western Mediterranean.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Historically, 264 BC was the year the first Punic War began between Rome and Carthage. Over the next 76 years many other wars changed the balance of power across the region. By 188 BC Rome had become the dominant power of the Mediterranean having defeated, contained or occupied Carthage, many Greek States and the Seleucid Empire.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, in this game each player takes on the role of one of the four major factions; Rome, Carthage, Egypt or the Seleucid Empire and will fight so that they can become the dominant power. Players will try to expand their territory, manoeuvre their armies and defeat their enemies in battle. Empires will pay in blood to rise or fall. How will history unfold this time?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Vector Wars set in a Tron style universe where the world has run dry of resources and clans fight in a virtual arena to gain one of the last remaining energy sources for there people known as Zetta Orbs. Vector Wars is a 2 player area domination game based on a 9 square board known as The Grid. You place one of your 9 character cards face down which gives little to no information to your opponent as to the strength of the card placed. These cards flip to give you an individual flip ability which you may use to battle to keep control of the grid. Your job is to try and gain the most victory points by maintaining a tactical advantage over your opponent which will ultimately gain you the victory.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

After looking at the value rolled, the &amp;ldquo;bomb&amp;rdquo; is set and they become the &amp;ldquo;Bomber&amp;rdquo;. The following player then rolls their black and white dice. They have three chances to score a value equal or higher than the one on bomb. If they succeed, they add a penalty to make it more difficult for them next time. If not, they take damage and mark it on their card. After every surviving player has been the &amp;quot;Bomber&amp;quot; once, the last player standing or with the least damage wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Landing on a space occupied by another &amp;quot;airship&amp;quot; also sends them back to start. An exact number is needed to win the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The goal is to complete a flight from New York to Paris ahead of your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

By drawing fences, players try to protect as many sheep as possible before the wolf comes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, players roll a die and draw a matching fence on the map. The game can last for 7 to 10 rounds, depending on the result of the die roll in the last 3 rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the game, each completely enclosed area will score the players points depending on the number of sheep within.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>At Phrasenfuchs it is important to recognize the phrase you are looking for as soon as possible. Not so easy, because you were alienated from six different species. So it may happen that the keywords are replaced by the &amp;quot;fox&amp;quot;, a phrase is to be drawn or only the topic and a keyword from the phrase is known. It also appears that all players at the same time rate it. In turn, a player always reads a phrase card. The color of the phrase card specifies the task. For example, crucial words in the read phrase are reversed or only snippets are read. The goal of the teammates is always the same: guess the phrases as fast as possible. Whoever manages to be the first to score points and pulls his character forward. And when the first goal is achieved, you win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Crossword puzzles with a difference: Kross the Wordz allows each player to choose one letter in turn, which everyone must then use. Quite tricky, if the sideline wants a Y, which now does not fit in their own word plans. Although one can also expose a disagreeable letter, but that gives negative points, and - of course - the longer the word, the more points there are.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here's how it works:&amp;#10;A player calls any letter. All players enter it on their block sheet. Everyone has a task card that they have to work on. The goal is to form as long and meaningful words as possible in order to fulfill the task. Whoever succeeds best, gets many points. If you do not want to enter a letter, take a penalty card from the middle. Who has the most points in the end, wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Unicorn Tears is a fast paced card game of strategy and wit. The game was designed and illustrated by a 13 year old entrepreneur with a passion for tabletop games!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws a Unicorn Tear and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid sudden death by Unicorn Tears by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, shuffling the deck or stopping the Unicorn Tears with the all powerful Anti Depressant card. There is even one unstoppable card called Buddy the Narwhal, Buddy allows you to switch your hand with any player you choose.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game gets more and more exciting and dangerous with each card you draw because the less cards that are left in the deck means a bigger chance of drawing a Unicorn Tear and dying an instant terrible death of shame and disappointment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>This turbulent card game for the whole family is, so to speak, Mau Mau, only cooperative and on time: All players try together in as little as 4 &amp;frac12; minutes as many of the total of 95 cards to play. Unusual, because you have to play so that the following players can possibly create as well. And the time is running - either via a conventional timer (kitchen timer or smartphone) or via the Music.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Here's how it works: The cards are face-up and the players have to take down cards in turn - as with Mau Mau you can put the same numbers or colors on top of each other. But you have to rethink: Since all have the same goal - namely, that as many as possible cards are stored within 4 &amp;frac12; minutes - you play as possible so that the other players can also serve. But there are two discard piles - this increases the chances. But the time is running - it means keep your nerves and overview.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>In FORVM, players compete to become the most prestigious Roman by having their agents engage in trade in markets across the Roman Empire. In each turn, agents are set out one step at a time across the network of markets to establish horrea (warehouses), negotiate alliances or break them apart, establish a presence in a region or prevent another player from accessing it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trade functions through every market where a player has established a warehouse. The further from Rome, the higher the transport and information costs and the lower the profit. But agents who are connected back to Rome are better informed, and so can get a better return. Fortunes can be made by creating continuous trade routes accessing the wealth of the edges of Empire and the Barbaricum beyond!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Money is not the only way for a player to grow in prestige; a combination of clever board control and alliances and benefactions allow a player to move up the cursus honorum (prestige ladder) to become Consul! But fate will always play a role, and can upset the most intricate of plans.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

You get a tie with a dragon, to keep it you must survive on the red moon until it opens again. Get power from the big dragons, Hunting, and stay in a constant search. Care for opponents, they should not know your power.&amp;#10;In this card game, 2-4 players are Dragonlords competing to survive on the red moon.&amp;#10;Players secretly choose a Big Dragon&amp;acute;s card with a power number, in turn they can gain power from that card, try to uncover the card of opponents, or look for new cards. The player who accumulates the most power at the end will win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Customers have 2 food cards and they take turns calling out the item on their card to the waiter.  If the waiter can walk over, feel around on their head, and deliver the correct item, they get to keep the card.  There are also action cards which the waiter can collect during play.  Once a waiter drops a piece of food or delivers the wrong item, they score one point per card they've collected and a new player gets to act as the waiter.  Most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;-description from designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Mix &amp;amp; Mayhem is a fast-paced family battling card game for 2 to 4 players. It can be played in 4 different ways, providing exciting variation and wide age range appeal.  One of the games aimed at young children is a simple mix and match stlye game. One of the other games is a Top Trumps style of selecting a category and the highest value wins. The other two of the game variations are trick taking games that involve trying to create the most powerful creatures and battling them against your opponent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game contains 72 cards, including 60 character cards and 12 special action cards.  The 60 character cards include 20 Head cards, 20 Torso cards, and 20 leg cards.  Combined in the right sequence, these cards create 20 fearsome characters ready to do battle, however, when the cards are mixed with cards from other characters they can create up to 8,000 unique characters each with their own unique name and powers. You will create crazy, scary, funny, unusual and wonderful characters to battle and try to defeat your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mix &amp;amp; Mayhem cards can be played in 4 different ways, You Complete Me, Wipe Them Out, Skirmish, and Bunch of Fives. The rules for each game are described below.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You Complete Me!&amp;#10;Preparation: Remove all of the Action cards. Shuffle the Character cards and place them in a pile&amp;#10;face down.&amp;#10;Playing the game: Decide who goes first, then each player takes it in turns to take a card from the pile and lay them face up in front of them. As the game progresses each player will be able to mix their cards to create weird and wonderful creatures as the game progresses.&amp;#10;The winner: The aim is to be the first player to create one of the 20 original characters made up of the set of correct 3 cards. If neither player is able to create one of the 20 original characters before the cards are all drawn then the cards are collected, re-shuffled, and drawn again until there is a winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Wipe Them Out!&amp;#10;Preparation: Split the cards into 3 separate piles for Heads, Torsos and Legs (including the Action cards which are also marked on the back of the card as Head, Torso and Legs cards). Shuffle each pile and deal the cards face down to each player so that each player has their own separate piles of Head&amp;#10;cards, Torso cards, and Leg cards. Each player should have the same number of body part cards.&amp;#10;To play the game: Each player picks up the top card of each pile of body parts so they have a complete character, with a Head card, Torso card and Legs card. If they pick up an Action card instead of a character body part they should keep this and draw another card from the top of the pile until they have a character body part. The Action cards that they may have picked up can be used during the game. Players hold the cards facing themselves, so only they can see them. Decide who goes first, then that player will select a category &amp;ndash; either Brains, Strength or Speed. Each player shows their card to reveal the value of the chosen body part. The player with the highest&amp;#10;value wins the battle and the player with the lowest value must discard the body part card that lost. Then the loser must pick up the next top card from their pile of the same category until they have a complete character again. The winner of the battle can keep the same cards in play. However, each card can only be used a maximum of 2 times to win a battle. After an individual body part card has won 2 battles it must be discarded and a new one drawn. Players will take it in turns to select a category. Both players must always have at least 3 cards in play, including a Head card, Torso card and Legs card in addition to any Action cards that have been collected. To create some extra mayhem the Action cards that have been drawn by players during the game can be used when it is their turn at any stage of the game. Once a player uses an Action card it must then be discarded.&amp;#10;The winner: The object of the game is to defeat your opponent by wiping out a pile of their cards so that they are no longer able to make up a full character and therefore unable to continue to battle. When a player is unable to make a complete character they are defeated and their opponent is the winner of the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Skirmish!&amp;#10;Preparation: Shuffle all of the cards (Character and Action cards) into a single pile.&amp;#10;Playing the game: Each player will take it in turns to draw a card from the top of the pile. The cards are laid face up so they are visible to both players.  When both players have a complete character of a Head card, Torso card and Legs card they are ready for battle. Players can create the character of&amp;#10;their choice to battle with from any of the character cards they have drawn. Each turn, players have the option to challenge their opponent to a battle, or to draw another card to&amp;#10;try and create more powerful characters. Once a challenge to battle has been made by either player, the characters they both have created for the battle must be declared and put side by side. The total character score is calculated by adding together the brains, strength and speed values, and the player&amp;#10;with the highest total character score wins that battle.  If a player is able to create one of the correct 20 unique character sets then their overall character score is increased by an extra 10 bonus points. The player who makes the challenge may think they have the most powerful character because they&amp;#10;can see the values of their opponent&amp;rsquo;s characters, however, their opponent may create mayhem by playing one of their Action cards that they have collected to swing the outcome of the battle. A player can use one or more Action cards at any time. Once a player uses an Action card it must then&amp;#10;be discarded. The players continue to draw further cards and engage in new battles with new characters until all&amp;#10;cards have been drawn and there are no further complete characters in the remaining cards held by both players.&amp;#10;The winner: The player who has won the most individual battles once all the cards have been drawn&amp;#10;wins the game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bunch of Fives!&amp;#10;Preparation: Remove all of the Action cards from the deck and deal all of the remaining character cards into separate Head, Torso and Legs piles. Each player will be dealt 3 Head cards, 3 Torso cards and 3 Legs cards, allowing each player to make up 3 separate characters. The cards are laid face down so they are not visible to the opposing player.  Each player should then privately arrange their cards to create 3 different characters with their own unique name and overall value.&amp;#10;Playing the game: Decide who goes first, then that player will lay down one of their characters to engage in battle with their opponent. The other player must then choose and lay down one of their characters. Whoever has the highest total score (by adding together the brains, strength and speed values) wins that hand. If a player is able to create one of the correct 20 unique character sets then their overall character score is increased by an extra 10 bonus points. Players will take it in turns to lay a character first. Once all 3 characters have battled the players will then be dealt another 3 Head cards, 3 Torso cards and 3 Legs cards for another round of 3 battles.&amp;#10;Following the second round of 3 battles there will be 1 final round of 3 battles, so there will be 3 rounds of 3 battles making a total of 9 battles. &amp;#10;The winner: The first player to win 5 battles is the winner of the game. It is possible therefore to&amp;#10;win the game outright after only 2 rounds without the need for the final round.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The election of the Aztec High Priest is imminent. In order to prove their value and merit, the contenders engage in a race for prestige to win the favor of the gods. Will you be able to make the most beautiful sculptures of feathered snakes (called C&amp;oacute;atl) to stand out and gain access to the coveted title of High Priest?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In C&amp;oacute;atl, players work to build the most beautiful and valuable serpents. The serpents, or C&amp;oacute;atl, are constructed with a head, a tail, and a number of body tiles, each made from chunky, colorful plastic. On a turn, players will either take tiles from the central board to their personal board, or work to construct one of their C&amp;oacute;atls with the different tiles they've collected.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Game end is triggered when one player finishes their third C&amp;oacute;atl. Players receive points for fulfilling objectives, and the one with the most is named the new High Priest!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;L&amp;rsquo;&amp;eacute;lection au titre de grand pr&amp;ecirc;tre azt&amp;egrave;que est imminente. Afin de prouver leur valeur et leur m&amp;eacute;rite, les pr&amp;eacute;tendants s&amp;rsquo;engagent dans une course au prestige pour conqu&amp;eacute;rir la faveur des dieux. Saurez-vous r&amp;eacute;aliser les plus belles sculptures de serpents &amp;agrave; plumes (appel&amp;eacute;s C&amp;oacute;atl) pour vous d&amp;eacute;marquer et ainsi acc&amp;eacute;der au titre tant convoit&amp;eacute; de grand pr&amp;ecirc;tre azt&amp;egrave;que?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dans C&amp;oacute;atl, les joueurs construisent les plus beaux et pr&amp;eacute;cieux serpents &amp;agrave; plumes qui soient. Ces reptiles, appel&amp;eacute;s C&amp;oacute;atl par les Azt&amp;egrave;ques, sont construits d'une t&amp;ecirc;te, une queue et un certain nombre de pi&amp;egrave;ces de corps en plastique &amp;eacute;pais et color&amp;eacute;. &amp;Agrave; tour de r&amp;ocirc;le, les joueurs prennent les pi&amp;egrave;ces du plateau central et les transposent sur leur plateau personnel afin d'assembler strat&amp;eacute;giquement des C&amp;oacute;atls en fonction des couleurs &amp;eacute;dict&amp;eacute;es par leurs cartes d'objectifs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;La partie se termine lorsqu'un joueur compl&amp;egrave;te son troisi&amp;egrave;me C&amp;oacute;atl. Les joueurs re&amp;ccedil;oivent des points pour la r&amp;eacute;alisation d'objectifs et celui qui en a cumul&amp;eacute; le plus est d&amp;eacute;clar&amp;eacute; grand pr&amp;ecirc;tre azt&amp;egrave;que!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Set in the titular city in the 16th century, Venice lets players take the role of wealthy, influential merchants as they ride their gondolas up and down the city's canals, train their assistants, complete contracts, and leverage their influence to gain political power. But business is anything but usual. As they broker contracts and flirt with crime, merchants must avoid arousing the suspicion of the Venetian Inquisition, lest they find themselves arrested and their businesses shut down.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the game, players move their two gondolas around the board. When they move a gondola, they may activate the assistants they have placed previously on any building they pass, but they may train (and improve the capabilities of) only the one on which they end their movement. Assistants allow you to gain resources, trade, make money, and take an array of other actions depending on the buildings to which they are assigned. When resources are made, they are placed in the gondola, and these will be used to fulfill lucrative contracts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Space is limited on the city's canals, however, and each time you pass another merchant's boat, gossip will spread, raising your suspicion level with the Inquisition. Lower your suspicion with visits and donations to the church, or academic institutions &amp;mdash; or throw caution to the wind and engage in unsavory activities for money or information. During the game, being such a well-known merchant can be a boon to your political career, but at game end, the most suspicious player will be made an example of by the Inquisition &amp;mdash; blocking your victory even if you have the most points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>The Road to Bethlehem - Journeys Through Time and Space is a family-weight, Christian-themed, RPG-style, cooperative game where players must work together, guided by a GM, to journey through ancient Palestine to arrive in Bethlehem to witness the Nativity and encounter the newborn infant Jesus.  Players play as modern day travelers who have been spirited away by the Archangel Gabriel (the GM) to partake of this journey.  Players must go through a series of scenarios, drawn randomly, during which they are offered choices by the GM which then dictates what challenges and choices they next face.  Players must conserve equipment and, most importantly, time on their journey, while also working to increase their individual attributes of Authority and Reputation.  The game uses the REAL System - a mechanic where the players do actual, physical interactive challenges at various points as part of the gameplay, the outcomes of which determine their progress in the game (such as identifying objects moved by the GM in a given room, finding commonplace house items within a certain time limit, or dexterity challenges). Once the players have gone through all 8 scenarios, they arrive at Bethlehem where which ending they've achieved is based on how much time they used on their journey.  The GM guides the players using 'The Book of Adventures' which contains step by step instructions for each scenario and narrative text that is read to the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is geared primarily towards families and can be played by multiple age levels from age 8 and up, but with the caveat that an adult always play as well and serve as the GM.  The total campaign with all the scenarios takes 4-6 hours to play, but the game can easily be saved between the scenarios, with each scenario taking roughly 30-60 minutes to complete.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>
